**Empathetic Listening**

Excerpted from [**Spirit of Oakland**](https://spiritofoakland.com/):

***Be Silent & Present***:

**Focus on the speaker**.  Realize they are sharing their feelings and it is OK to hear and OK to share personal truths – it is healthy to do so even if you do not know what to do with the information.  ***We are only here to listen, not to solve***.

***Receive, Don't Relate***:

When you can relate to a person's story, you can start thinking about similarities/differences and whether you like them or not.  You are no longer listening, but assessing and possibly judging.  Unfortunately, you can miss the opportunity to understand what the person is saying and why.  ***So, just listen***.

***Appreciate***:

Nodding, slight noises of understanding, “MmHm” lets the speaker know that you are following, are listening, and understand.  It does not have to mean that you understand inherently her/his perspective, or even agree.  It means you are giving consideration to all that he/she says, **you respect him/her****, and you're thinking about it.

**Summarize****:

**Report what you just heard** the speaker say and pinpoint the things that were important to her/him.  “So, it was really lonely after your family moved away.”

***Ask Questions***:

It gives the speaker a chance to think of things she/he may not have before.  It gives him/her a chance to fill in gaps of understanding for you and others he/she may present this information to in the future.  It may help her/him heal and it may help you understand ***a perspective you had not considered before***.

***Consent***:

Sometimes while listening to what can seem like a problem, you can have ideas to resolve those issues.  It is a good idea to **focus on the speaker** until he/she has completed her/his thought, then **ASK for consent** to offer advice or think of solutions.  You can say, “Would you like me to listen and be a sounding board, or would you like my input, my advice?”

***Body Language***:

Body language, like folded arms and crossed legs, sometimes creates a **feeling of speculation and mistrust**, and does nothing to open the lines of trust and communication between the speaker and listener.  Try facing the speaker, occasionally making eye contact.  You don't have to stare.  Leave your chests, arms and legs open at your sides evenly.  ***An even body projects an even, open mind***.
