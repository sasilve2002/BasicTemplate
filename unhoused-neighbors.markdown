**Things You Can Do to Help Our Unhoused Neighbors** 

**1.**	Get to know the unhoused neighbors in your neighborhood.  **Share** hot coffee, provisions, a smile & human kindness **on a regular basis**.  Develop friendships & long-term solidarity.  We are **rebuilding community**!

**2.**	**No “poverty porn.”**   When you are out there being a good neighbor, don't take voyeuristic pictures of people living on the streets.  No selfies with your “new homeless friend.”  Just be a good neighbor.  No need for Facebook to know.  **It's “keeping It real” that actually does good and teaches**.

**3.**	The **homeless crisis** is a humanitarian crisis, **not a career**.   Don't try to make your interactions with the unsheltered your new career, non-profit, start-up or project that needs to get funded.  This is not a professional field.  This is a human crisis.  And, if you do get funding, give the money to the unsheltererd.  **Don't make a job out of other people's suffering.
**
**4.**	Do not **illegally dump** your trash, old furniture, “donations” at encampments.  **People call the encampments home.**

**5.**	**Solidarity, not charity.**  Deprivation is a built-in product of a class system.  Solidarity = bearing hardships together.  Anything given to people on the street is in fact a return of what a system has taken by force and design.

**6.**	Commit yourself to encampment defense and support.  **Organize** your people into groups capable of mobilizing & responding to sweeps, harassment & calls for support & action.  It is **collective action that builds power**.

7.	Direct action gets the goods.  We all need to stop waiting, expecting, begging the powers that be to “solve” the housing & homeless crisis they created.  Take land & build homes.  Be Bold, Beautiful & Unapologetic in your autonomous community-led solutions.  The crisis is your permit. Humanity is the code & license.

8.	Educate yourself.  Lies, myths & stereotypes create the public acceptance of criminalizing the homeless.  This demonization of unsheltered neighbors provides cover for the violence & deprivation. It also excuses the system that created the situation.  Intervene on your neighborhood listservs when they go off on unhoused people!  All the suggestions on this flyer will give you a great education on what's up.  But, for starters, read materials from the National Law Center for Homelessness and Poverty : https://www.nichp.org/   Or follow @The Village in Oakland #feedthepeople on Facebook.

9.	Never call the cops.  And don't call the City to complain.  Remember that homelessness is not a crime and housing is a human right.  Marginalized people never fare well in any interaction with authorities.  The authorities have no solutions to offer and any exposure to them boosts the chances of incarceration and violence through the roof.

10.	Be humble.  If you are an activist going out to the camps, remember you are coming uninvited to someone's home.  So act like your mama raised you right and don't come empty handed.  Bring something like socks or coffee.  Something.  And don't go pushing your political agenda on people you just met.  Trust you will have way more to learn from the most resilient and most vulnerable of Oakland.  Listen before you preach.
