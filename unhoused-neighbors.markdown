**Things You Can Do to Help Our Unhoused Neighbors** 

**1.**	Get to know the unhoused neighbors in your neighborhood.  **Share** hot coffee, provisions, a smile & human kindness **on a regular basis**.  Develop friendships & long-term solidarity.  We are **rebuilding community**!

**2.**	**No “poverty porn.”**   When you are out there being a good neighbor, don't take voyeuristic pictures of people living on the streets.  No selfies with your “new homeless friend.”  Just be a good neighbor.  No need for Facebook to know.  **It's “keeping It real” that actually does good and teaches**.

**3.**	The **homeless crisis** is a humanitarian crisis, **not a career**.   Don't try to make your interactions with the unsheltered your new career, non-profit, start-up or project that needs to get funded.  This is not a professional field.  This is a human crisis.  And, if you do get funding, give the money to the unsheltererd.  Don't make a job out of other people's suffering.

**4.**	Do not **illegally dump** your trash, old furniture, “donations” at encampments.  **People call the encampments home.**

**5.**	**Solidarity, not charity.**  Deprivation is a built-in product of a class system.  Solidarity = bearing hardships together.  Anything given to people on the street is in fact a return of what a system has taken by force and design.

**6.**	Commit yourself to encampment defense and support.  **Organize** your people into groups capable of mobilizing & responding to sweeps, harassment & calls for support & action.  It is **collective action that builds power**.

**7.**	**Direct action** gets the goods.  We all need to stop waiting, expecting, begging the powers that be to “solve” the housing & homeless crisis they created.  Take land & build homes.  Be Bold, Beautiful & Unapologetic in your autonomous community-led solutions.  The crisis is your permit. Humanity is the code & license.

**8.**	**Educate yourself**.  Lies, myths & stereotypes create the public acceptance of criminalizing the homeless.  This **demonization of unsheltered neighbors** provides cover for the violence & deprivation. It also excuses the system that created the situation.  Intervene on your neighborhood listservs when they go off on unhoused people!  All the suggestions on this flyer will give you a great education on what's up.  But, for starters, read materials from the [**National Law Center for Homelessness and Poverty**](https://www.nichp.org/).  Or follow [**@The Village in Oakland #feedthepeople on Facebook**](https://www.facebook.com/The-Village-in-Oakland-feedthepeople-731643677003021/).

**9.**	**Never call the cops**.  And don't call the City to complain.  Remember that **homelessness is not a crime** and **housing is a human right**.  Marginalized people never fare well in any interaction with authorities.  The authorities have no solutions to offer and any exposure to them boosts the chances of incarceration and violence through the roof.

**10.**	**Be humble**.  If you are an activist going out to the camps, remember **you are coming uninvited to someone's home**.  So act like your mama raised you right and don't come empty handed.  **Bring something** like socks or coffee.  Something.  And don't go pushing your political agenda on people you just met.  Trust you will have way more to learn from the most resilient and most vulnerable of Oakland.  **Listen before you preach**.

Excerpted from [**Spirit of Oakland**](https://spiritofoakland.com/):

***Be Silent & Present***:

**Focus on the speaker**.  Realize they are sharing their feelings and it is OK to hear and OK to share personal truths – it is healthy to do so even if you do not know what to do with the information.  ***We are only here to listen, not to solve***.

***Receive, Don't Relate***:

When you can relate to a person's story, you can start thinking about similarities/differences and whether you like them or not.  You are no longer listening, but assessing and possibly judging.  Unfortunately, you can miss the opportunity to understand what the person is saying and why.  ***So, just listen***.

***Appreciate***:

Nodding, slight noises of understanding, “MmHm” lets the speaker know that you are following, are listening, and understand.  It does not have to mean that you understand inherently her/his perspective, or even agree.  It means you are giving consideration to all that he/she says, **you respect him/her****, and you're thinking about it.

**Summarize****:

**Report what you just heard** the speaker say and pinpoint the things that were important to her/him.  “So, it was really lonely after your family moved away.”

***Ask Questions***:

It gives the speaker a chance to think of things she/he may not have before.  It gives him/her a chance to fill in gaps of understanding for you and others he/she may present this information to in the future.  It may help her/him heal and it may help you understand ***a perspective you had not considered before***.

***Consent***:

Sometimes while listening to what can seem like a problem, you can have ideas to resolve those issues.  It is a good idea to **focus on the speaker** until he/she has completed her/his thought, then **ASK for consent** to offer advice or think of solutions.  You can say, “Would you like me to listen and be a sounding board, or would you like my input, my advice?”

***Body Language***:

Body language, like folded arms and crossed legs, sometimes creates a **feeling of speculation and mistrust**, and does nothing to open the lines of trust and communication between the speaker and listener.  Try facing the speaker, occasionally making eye contact.  You don't have to stare.  Leave your chests, arms and legs open at your sides evenly.  ***An even body projects an even, open mind***.
