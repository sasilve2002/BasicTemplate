[**https://contact@getamplify.org**](http://contact@getamplify.org) Postcards to Voters : "We're excited to announce a new tool that we think will increase our collective impact. We have begun sending out our recommended calls to action via Amplify, an app developed by Indivisible San Francisco for itself and other groups.

We all want to be in the habit of doing the weekly Postcards to Voters actions. But it's hard to do that if it feels like we're each acting alone. On Amplify, we can all see each other taking action, and cheer each other on. You can view scripts and call Members of Congress right from the app, so it will be easy to take action whenever you have a few minutes.

Please follow the instructions below to join us on the app:

1. Use your phone to go to https://getamplify.org/install
2. When it asks, use the Postcards to Voters invite code: 051716000
3. Take an action & cheer others on! "

## ***More Groups***:

**THE GROUPS REJUVENATING THE DEMOCRATS**

[**SWING LEFT**](https://swingleft.org/) coordinates funding and volunteers to help Democrats win Republican-held seats in swing districts. It has targeted 64 House seats for the 2018 mid-terms.

[**INDIVISIBLE**](https://www.indivisible.org/), a virtually self-organized national effort, began as a Google Doc after the 2016 election. It has attracted a good many experienced political professionals, and it concentrates on blocking Trump’s federal initiatives.

[**THE SISTER DISTRICT PROJECT**](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/) works on electing Democrats to state legislatures. It claims some 25,000 volunteers in 50 states.

[**RUN FOR SOMETHING**](https://www.runforsomething.net/) focuses on recruiting and mentoring younger people to run in down-ballot races.

[**EMILY’S LIST**](https://www.emilyslist.org/) recruits and trains pro-choice female Democratic candidates. The 32-year-old group has seen an explosion of interest since the election, with more than 17,000 women signing up for its “Run to Win” training program. As a result, the organization has tripled its state and local staff operations.

[**OUR REVOLUTION**](https://ourrevolution.com/) was created by Sen. Bernie Sanders to sustain the momentum of the his 2016 campaign. It claims some 400 local chapters and focuses on taking control of the Democratic Party and on supporting progressive candidates in the vast number of state and local races that normally get little attention.

[**BRAND NEW CONGRESS**](http://brandnewcongress.org/), a political action committee established by former staffers and supporters of Bernie Sanders’ campaign, works to elect Democrats to Congress who support Sanders’ policies and platform, even if that means opposing sitting Democrats in party primaries.

[**THE MOVEMENT FOR BLACK LIVES**](https://policy.m4bl.org/), which began as a protest movement against police violence in 2013, is still in the streets, but it has begun focusing on get-out-the-vote drives and local electoral campaigns, such as the race for Philadelphia district attorney.

[**LABOR FOR OUR REVOLUTION**](https://www.facebook.com/pg/LaborforOurRevolution/about/?ref=page_internal) grew out of Labor for Bernie, a coalition of union members who backed Sanders in 2016. They recently launched a campaign with organizations such as JUSTICE DEMOCRATS and NATIONAL NURSES UNITED to pressure Democrats in Congress to sign on to a progressive People’s Platform.

[**DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA**](http://www.dsausa.org/), founded in 1982, has more than doubled its membership since the election, becoming the nation’s largest socialist organization, with over 120 chapters. The group has developed a plan to help progressives win local elections and to build support for national political change.

[**WORKING FAMILIES PARTY**](http://workingfamilies.org/), created two decades ago in New York City to push the state Democrats to the left, has since expanded to a dozen other states and created a national membership. It endorses and runs candidates and builds community-labor coalitions to press for progressive policies.
