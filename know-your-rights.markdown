**All people** in the United States, regardless of immigration status, have certain **rights and protections** under the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution). The [**ILRC’s Red Cards**](https://www.ilrc.org/red-cards) help people assert their rights and defend themselves in many situations, such as when ICE agents go to a home.
