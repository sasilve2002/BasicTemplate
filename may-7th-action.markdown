Re:  Support of A.B. 3 the Strong Public Defenders Act

Dear Members of the Assembly Appropriations Committee:

I am a California constituent writing in support of A.B. 3.  AB 3 provides our public defenders with the necessary resources and training to adequately advise their clients about any possible immigration consequences in their cases. (insert your own story/opinion here ) If passed, California would take a significant step toward helping prevent avoidable deportations.  Please vote yes for A.B. 3.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Re: Support of A.B. 6 The Due Process For All Act

Dear Members of the Assembly Judiciary Committee:

I am a California constituent and writing in support of A.B. 6.  A.B. 6 gives immigrants facing deportation a shot at a fair immigration court hearing by ensuring they have qualified immigration attorneys to represent them. (insert your own story/opinion here ) By providing counsel in deportation proceedings, California will help keep families together and secure, employees working, and communities whole.  Please vote yes for A.B. 6.

Thank you.

Sincerely,

Re: Support for S.B. 54 The California Values Act

Dear Assemblymember __________:

I am a California constituent writing to you in favor of S.B. 54.
S.B. 54 ensures that no state or local resources are diverted to fuel any attempt by the federal government to carry out mass deportations and that our schools, our hospitals, and our courthouses are safe spaces for everyone in our community. (insert your personal story/opinion etc.) Now is the time for California to stand up to attempts by Trump and his new administration to institute draconian, punitive, and discriminatory immigration policies. Please vote yes on S.B. 54.

Thank you.

Sincerely,


These letters are important - California is the Beacon!
