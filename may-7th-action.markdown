Re: Support for S.B. 54 The California Values Act
Dear Assemblymember __________:
I am a California constituent writing to you in favor of S.B. 54.
S.B. 54 ensures that no state or local resources are diverted to fuel any attempt by the federal government to carry out mass deportations and that our schools, our hospitals, and our courthouses are safe spaces for everyone in our community. (insert your personal story/opinion etc.) Now is the time for California to respond to attempts by Trump and his new administration to institute draconian, punitive, and discriminatory immigration policies. Please vote yes on S.B. 54.
Thank you.
Sincerely,

Re:  Support of A.B. 3 the Strong Public Defenders Act
Dear Members of the Assembly Appropriations Committee:
I am a California constintuent writing in support of A.B. 3.  
AB 3 provides our public defenders with the necessary resources and training to adequately advise their clients about any possible immigration consequences in their cases. (insert your own story/opinion here ) If passed, California would take a significant step toward helping prevent avoidable deportations.
