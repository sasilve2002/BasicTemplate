**[Highlights from NonprofitVote's 2016 "America Goes to the Polls"](https://www.nonprofitvote.org/america-goes-to-the-polls-2016/):**

"National **turnout** of eligible voters was **60.2%** - **Four in 10 eligible voters did not vote.**
The **highest turnout** states were Minnesota (74.8%), Maine (72.8%), New Hampshire (72.5%), Colorado (72.1%), Wisconsin (70.5%), and Iowa (69.0%). **All six offered same day voter registration**, enabling voters to register or update their registration when they vote. Five were battleground states targeted by the campaigns.
The **lowest turnout** states were Hawaii (43%), West Virginia (50.8%), Texas (51.6%), Tennessee (52.0%) and Arkansas (53.1%). These five states were at the bottom for the third consecutive presidential election. None were battleground states. **All five cut off the ability to register or update a registration three to four weeks before Election Day**."

"  **Failure** to effectively **reach** members of **Congress** has **disastrous** consequences.
