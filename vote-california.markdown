***Write to your Reps !***

From [**Democracy.io**](https://democracy.io/#!/) : 

"  **Failure** to effectively **reach** members of **Congress** has **disastrous** consequences. Studies show that politicians fundamentally **misconceive their constituents’ views**, making it harder for them to represent us in the lawmaking process.  "

"  That’s why we built [**Democracy.io**](https://democracy.io/#!/): **a new tool** to put you in touch with your members of Congress—with as **few clicks as possible**."
