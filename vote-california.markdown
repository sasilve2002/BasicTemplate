From [**Democracy.io**](https://democracy.io/#!/) : 

"  **Failure** to effectively **reach** members of **Congress** has **disastrous** consequences. [**Studies show**](https://promarket.org/study-politicians-vote-will-constituents-35-percent-time/) that politicians fundamentally **misconceive their constituents’ views**, making it harder for them to represent us in the lawmaking process.  "
