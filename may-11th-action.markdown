Good morning, Nothing Rhymes with Orange Flippers :)

Go to May 9th Action for the link to:

**virtual phone bank** you can do from your easy chair, to elect **Tom Perriello for Governor of Virginia**

If you haven't yet had a chance to try phone banking, give it a try.  It's a learning experience!  And, these phone banks have made a dramatic impact on those quiet little special elections and run-offs that usually invite low participation.  In this Twit environment, helping to promote democratic voices in Congress is an absolute necessity.
