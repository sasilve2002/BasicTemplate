**Agenda** (updated):  

[Special Visitor: Myisha from Sidewalk Talk ](http://www.sidewalktalksf.com/) 

**1**. Bring your favorite writing implements - I have 50 addresses to write to **South Carolina** :  

The general election is **SC-05** - June 20, 2017 - [Archie Parnell won the Democratic primary](https://ballotpedia.org/Archie_Parnell).  The seat was vacated when Mick Mulvaney (R) was confirmed as director of the US Office of Management and Budget.  We'll be writing to remind **blue South Caroliners** to vote.

I have stamps and USPS postcards, but if you have blank postcards, please bring them.  We'll have a "tip" jar to cover expenses :)

**2**. We'll sign up for various resistance sites.

**3**. Upcoming marches & events

Please feel free to **bring friends, family, neighbors** to our meetings - each new contact is a success for resisting the Twitter Twit.  

You are **protecting our democracy** in spite of **Twit's insane distractions**.
