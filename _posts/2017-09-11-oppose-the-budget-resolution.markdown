Excerpted from [Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/) :

"  While all eyes were on the Senate and the fight over health care this past summer, the **House** of Representatives started moving on the **[FY18 budget resolution](https://budget.house.gov/budgets/fy18/)**. Since **Republicans** want to use the special process called “**reconciliation**” to pass the **Trump Tax Scam**, first they need to pass the **[FY18 budget resolution](https://budget.house.gov/budgets/fy18/)**. It’s especially important that your Senators hear from you using the **sample call script** below, as the Senate resolution is being **drafted as we speak**.  "
