With the Georgia special election coming up in a few weeks (June 20th), we can help Jon Ossoff’s campaign by attending a House Party -
there are a couple happening in San Francisco, sponsored by [SwingLeft](https://swingleft.org/special-election-house-parties). https://swingleft.org/special-election-house-parties

Your conversations with voters in Georgia could mean the difference between a win and a loss on June 20th. They help bolster the campaign’s capacity to reach out to critical swing voters and get Democratic voters the information they need to turn out on election day.
