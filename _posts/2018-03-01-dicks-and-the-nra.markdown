***Let's write a feel-good postcard*:**

Excerpted from [**Postcards from Kate**](https://www.postcardsfromkate.org/):

"[DICK'S Sporting Goods](https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/) announced they will no longer sell [assault-style rifles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon), high capacity magazines nor guns to anyone under the age of 21. And, they're calling on politicians to pass "common sense gun reform" which would include laws to raise the minimum purchase age to 21, banning assault-type weapons and bump stocks and improving universal background checks.

//"Our thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims and their loved ones," the company said. "But thoughts and prayers are not enough. We have tremendous respect and admiration for the students organizing and making their voices heard regarding gun violence in schools and elsewhere in our country. ...We have heard you. The nation has heard you. ... the systems in place are not effective to protect our kids and our citizens. The company asserted its support for the Second Amendment, but continued, "we have to help solve the problem that's in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic."//

Let's thank [**CEO Edward Stack**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_W._Stack) for making this decision and having the courage to show that '**enough is enough**.'
