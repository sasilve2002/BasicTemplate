Excerpted from [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/):

" **Trumpcare** is up in **TWO WEEKS** in the **Senate**—and the final version is even worse than before. 

We need you to **call your Democratic Senators** and tell them to put up EVERY possible **obstruction** to Trumpcare. Fight to the end and never surrender. 

**Call** 
Senator Kamala D. **Harris**
**(202) 224-3553** 
and 
Senator Dianne **Feinstein** 
**(202) 224-3841**. 
When you reach an aide, leave the following **message**: 

Hello, my name is _________ calling from zip code _______. While I **thank you for opposing Trumpcare**, I am counting on you to use every tool, tactic and procedure at your disposal to **also delay and block** it as a long as possible. Thank you for your time.

Phone call won't get through? 
**Sign and send** the petition to your Democratic Senator: **Delay, Delay, Delay Trumpcare**! 

If you don't live in a state with a Republican senator, the whole experience can feel very disempowering—it does for me. But while our Democratic senators have unanimously opposed Trumpcare, there is more they can do to fight and defeat this. 

Republicans are hell-bent on passing Trumpcare in the Senate. The new version guts Medicaid, includes Ted Cruz's awful idea to let insurance companies sell bad health plans, and the bill is so terrible that members of Congress would exempt themselves from its provisions. 

Keep fighting,
