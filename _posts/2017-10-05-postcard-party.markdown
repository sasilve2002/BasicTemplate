This month, we have been VERY BUSY !!  In **September** alone, we've ACTED on **Guns, Healthcare, Puerto Rico, and Twit's tax plan**.  

**Upcoming elections** will determine how the **Congress** will ACT on the zillions of issues facing our world.  

The **BIG PUSH** is here for flipping red districts blue.   [**Click here for more info on Virginia**](http://www.whyvamatters2017.com/).

So, please come to our **Postcard Party** at our next meeting, where we will be writing **100 postcards to Virginia** (ala [**Postcards4VA**](https://postcards4va.com/)) - cards have to be mailed by Oct 25th :
