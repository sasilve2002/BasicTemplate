Excerpted from [Indivisible](https://www.indivisible.us/) :

"   The main thing everyone must do this week is to let your Senators know how much you hate this bill and how much you’ll make them pay for supporting it. **Make a call** (make many calls!), **show up**, make your voice heard!   "

FYI - here's a short script for leaving a message:

*Hello! My name is [name] and I’m calling from [place in state]. I know that [Senator Harris/Feinstein] opposes TrumpCare, the American Health Care Act.   I'm calling to ask her to withhold consent on amendments, place holds on nominations, and object to all unanimous consent requests until the reconciliation instructions expire and to use every tool she has. That includes offering as many amendments as it takes to draw out Senate debate on this bill during vote-a-rama.  Thank you.*
