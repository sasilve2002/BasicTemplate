Excerpted from [**Health Access**](http://www.health-access.org/) :

"   **Health Access** is supporting **two bills** to help **protect consumers** from [Twitter Twit's] attacks:

[**SB 133 (Hernandez)**](http://sd22.senate.ca.gov/news/2017-08-29-893-kpcc-bill-aims-help-those-complex-conditions-if-their-insurer-leaves-market): 
Provides **continuity of care** in the situation where individual insurance consumers are forced to change health plans through no fault of their own (such as an insurer leaving their region). The bill ensures these **consumers can stay** with a doctor or provider to finish a course of treatment (like a pregnancy or chemotherapy) for up to a year. 
[**AB 156 (Wood)**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB156): 
Despite the federal government cutting open enrollment in half, this bill would allow our state to maintain Covered California's 3-month open enrollment period and moves the end-date into January to allow consumers more time to purchase health insurance after the holidays.
