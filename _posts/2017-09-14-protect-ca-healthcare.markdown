Excerpted from [**Health Access**](http://www.health-access.org/) :

"   **Health Access** is supporting **two bills** to help **protect consumers** from [Twitter Twit's] attacks:

[**SB 133 (Hernandez)**](http://sd22.senate.ca.gov/news/2017-08-29-893-kpcc-bill-aims-help-those-complex-conditions-if-their-insurer-leaves-market): 
Provides **continuity of care** in the situation where individual insurance consumers are forced to change health plans through no fault of their own (such as an insurer leaving their region). The bill ensures these **consumers can stay** with a doctor or provider to finish a course of treatment (like a pregnancy or chemotherapy) for up to a year. 

[**AB 156 (Wood)**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB156): 
Despite the federal government cutting open enrollment in half, this bill would **allow** our state to **maintain Covered California's 3-month open enrollment** period and moves the end-date into January to allow consumers more time to purchase health insurance after the holidays. 

These bills will be voted on **THIS WEEK**. Call or FAX Assembly Member [**Rob Bonta**](https://a18.asmdc.org/) NOW and ask him to support these crucial bills!  "

**Sample Script**:

My name is ________ and I'm calling from _________ to ask **Assemblymember Bonta** to please support **SB 133 (Hernandez) **and **AB 156 (Wood)**.  
The Administration's efforts to attack the Affordable Care Act, has led **Anthem Blue Cross and Cigna to abandon** some regions in our state's **individual health insurance market**, leaving over 300,000 Californians in need of finding new health plans.  **SB 133 and AB 156** will help protect consumers from these attacks.  Thank you.
