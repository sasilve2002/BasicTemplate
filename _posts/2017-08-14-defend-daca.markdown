[RSVP here for the **DACA Day of Action**](https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/defend-daca?source=indivisble) [**Tomorrow, Tuesday**], **August 15th**. With actual **neo-Nazis** now rallying nationally, itâ€™s important we show support for **people from every background, immigrant and native**. 

*Albert Einstein (1879 - 1955)
"The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing."*
