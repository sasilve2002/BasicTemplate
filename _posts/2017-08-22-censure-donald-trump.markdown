Excerpted from [MoveOn.org](https://front.moveon.org/) :
Add your name: [Support a congressional resolution to formally censure Donald Trump](https://petitions.moveon.org/sign/censure-trump?source=s.fwd&r_by=5557365).

"  Days after the tragedy and violence in Charlottesville, President Trump has continued to signal his support for the racists, white nationalists, and neo-Nazis who coordinated the "Unite the Right" rally. 

That’s why we, [Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman](https://watsoncoleman.house.gov/), Pramila Jayapal, and [Jerrold Nadler](https://nadler.house.gov/), introduced a resolution to formally censure Donald Trump for refusing to condemn the KKK and neo-Nazis and for harboring white nationalists. It also calls on him to fire those advisers who cater to white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

More than 100 of our Democratic colleagues have co-sponsored this resolution, and already more than 131,000 fellow MoveOn members have signed on in support.

Can you add your name now so that we can deliver your signature and double down on our campaign to censure Trump as soon as Congress is back in session?

Together, we’ll speak in one, powerful voice.
