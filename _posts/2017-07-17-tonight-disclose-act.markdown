"  On **Wednesday**, the Senate Rules Committee must decide whether to grant the routine request for Assemblymember **Mullin** to take over as author of **AB 249** before they go into a month-long recess — or effectively kill AB 249 for the year without even a hearing.

**PLEASE SIGN the NEW emergency petition** to Senate President pro Tem Kevin de Leon and Senate Rules even if you've signed another — Tell them to **give AB 249 its author and hearing**!

[Sign **New EMERGENCY petition** to save **AB 249**, the **California DISCLOSE Act**!](https://www.yesfairelections.org/petition/ab249-ccmaf.php?recipientId=vDIQcf26fXWZyeh2V211w1&email=greglpennington@aol.com&ms=newsletter-2017-07-17-new-author) "
