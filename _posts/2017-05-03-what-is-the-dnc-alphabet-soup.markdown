**DNC, DCCC, DSCC: How to decipher the alphabet soup of Democratic Party organizations 
**
The **DNC (Democratic National Committee) is the presidential committee**. It raises money, primarily, for the presidential race every four years. It oversees the primary/caucus process, setting rules and coordinating debates.  What the DNC isn’t is a shadowy umbrella organization that controls all the other alphabet committees. 

The **DCCC (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) is the committee that has jurisdiction over House races**. The DCCC raises its own money—it doesn’t get any from the DNC—and spends it exclusively on House races. Despite the fact that your spam filter is probably cluttered with the DCCC’s notorious "DOOOOOM" fundraising e-mails, much of the DCCC’s money, in fact, comes from the Democrats’ own House members, who are expected to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in dues to the committee (though they don’t always do that). 

The **DSCC (Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee) is the Senate-side counterpart of the DCCC**. It’s funded by the Democratic senators themselves as well as outside donors, and it’s controlled by Democratic leadership in the Senate. 

The **DGA (Democratic Governors Association) is the organization that’s oriented toward electing Democratic governors**.  

The **DLCC (Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee) is the organization that’s tasked with organizing and funding** the thousands of legislative races all around the country, a nearly impossible job given how much data needs to be kept track of, and how much money they need to accomplish their goals versus how little priority anyone ever pays to legislative races. 	

Side note: Please do not confuse the DLCC with the **DLC (Democratic Leadership Council), a centrist think-tank/advocacy group** that, most importantly, no longer exists, as of 2011.
