This morning from the **NEA**:

Today marks Betsy **DeVosâ€™s** 100th day as **Education Secretary**, and since the very beginning, she has proven she is unqualified for the job. And **next week**, when she testifies before the **House Appropriations Committee** about her plans to slash public education funding, we can expect more of the same.

**Action**:  Call **1-855-764-1010**. Your call will be automatically directed to the MoC for your zip code.  

**Script**:  

Hi, my name is _____ . I am calling to ask the {senator/representative} to oppose this administration's attempt to privatize public education.  Diverting scarce dollars away from our public schools and giving it to private schools that are unaccountable to the public will destroy our public education system.  Please stand up to the cuts in public education. Thank you.
