"  Tell Your Democratic MoC to Stand Strong Against the Trump Tax Scam "

Trump Tax Scam ... eliminate taxes that only affect the wealthiest individuals and let corporations pay even less than they already do. ... Their plan is to use the same secretive, partisan process they tried (and failed) to use for health care, using “reconciliation” to pass the Trump Tax Scam through the Senate with only 51 votes.  The first step is to pass a bill through the House, which is why it’s **critical that we tell Democrats they need to stand strong against the Trump Tax Scam. 

The more we can **DELAY** this bill and give people time to learn about what’s really in it, the better a chance we have of stopping the Trump Tax Scam before it ever gets off the ground. Call your Democratic MoC and tell them: do everything you can to prevent tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. **NO to the Trump Tax Scam**.
