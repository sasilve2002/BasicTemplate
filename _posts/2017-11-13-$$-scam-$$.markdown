"  Tell Your Democratic MoC to Stand Strong Against the Trump Tax Scam "

Trump Tax Scam ... eliminate taxes that only affect the wealthiest individuals and let corporations pay even less than they already do. ... Their plan is to use the same secretive, partisan process they tried (and failed) to use for health care, using “reconciliation” to pass the Trump Tax Scam through the Senate with only 51 votes.
