"  Tell Your Democratic MoC to Stand Strong Against the Trump Tax Scam "

"  [**Trump Tax Scam**](http://www.factcheck.org/2017/09/trumps-tax-plan-rich/) ... **eliminate taxes** that only affect the **wealthiest** individuals **and** let **corporations** pay even less than they already do. ... Their plan is to use the same **secretive, partisan process** they tried (and failed) to use for health care, using “**reconciliation**” to pass the Trump Tax Scam through the Senate with only **51 votes**.  The first step is to pass a bill through the House, which is why it’s critical that we tell **Democrats** they **need to stand strong** against the Trump Tax Scam. "

"  The more we can **DELAY** this bill and give people time to learn about what’s really in it, the better a chance we have of stopping the Trump Tax Scam before it ever gets off the ground. **Call your Democratic MoC and tell them**: do everything you can to prevent tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. **NO to the Trump Tax Scam**.
