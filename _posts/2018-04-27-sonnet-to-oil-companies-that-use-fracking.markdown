***Sonnet to Oil Companies that Use Fracking***:

**HOW  DARE  YOU?**

How dare you desecrate our Mother Earth,
Our peerless azure marble poised in space?
If you could see and value her true worth,
You’d not allow these frackers to deface.

What good is wealth if decency depart,
When treasured public landscapes you despoil?
Your fracking strikes a dagger to Earth’s heart.
You stop at nothing in your search for oil.

For fracturing her crust and fouling air,
Our Mother Earth sends tremblors in complaint.
Once pristine waters now lie fetid, bare.
It’s time to use our reason and restraint.

How dare you to commit this travesty?
One day, all life on Earth could cease to be.
