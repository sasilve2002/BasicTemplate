"  [**Tell Congress**](https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/Arizona?actionId=AR0066783&_ga=2.50182369.695833903.1504396104-306019161.1504396104): **No Trump Wall**!

[**Tell Congress**](https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/Arizona?actionId=AR0066783&_ga=2.50182369.695833903.1504396104-306019161.1504396104) not to waste billions on ineffective, harmful border walls!

Donald **Trump** will ask Congress to appropriate **tens of billions** (yes, that is billion with a B) of dollars to build hundreds of miles of new border walls, even though the walls that are already there have done **tremendous damage** to borderlands **ecosystems** and **communities** and do little to improve security. [Tell Congress to **just say NO**](https://sierra.secure.force.com/actions/Arizona?actionId=AR0066783&_ga=2.50182369.695833903.1504396104-306019161.1504396104)!

But for all of the **environmental damage** done -- the national wildlife refuges and national monuments that have been scarred, the hundreds of farmers and ranchers who have had their **property condemned**, and the nearly **$3 billion** that has been spent so far -- the **Congressional Research Service** reports that border walls have had **“no discernible impact”** on immigration or smuggling.
