Excerpted from [Wall-of-Us](https://www.wallofus.org/):

"  Trump is unraveling. Just this week he has recklessly disavowed the Iran nuclear deal, signed a slew of executive orders to heartlessly gut the ACA, and earned the (dis)honor of being the first sitting President to address an anti-LGBTQ event. There’s no telling what - or who - this unhinged mad king targets next. But there are some likely suspects -- namely Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller who’s investigating Russiagate.  "

"  Bi-partisan legislation has been introduced in both the Senate and the House to preserve Mueller's independence and protect him from Trump’s next 4 am pique of rage. Sad! that this is what’s required.  "
