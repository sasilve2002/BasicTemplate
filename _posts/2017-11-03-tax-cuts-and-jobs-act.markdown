Excerpted from [**OFA BERKELEY**](https://www.ofa.us/) + [**INDIVISIBLE BERKELEY HEALTH TEAM**](https://www.indivisibleberkeley.org/teams)

"Today, House Republican leaders released their [draft tax code](https://www.countable.us/articles/1372-s-house-gop-tax-plan) overhaul that would give the wealthiest people and corporations giant tax breaks which, in turn, set in motion a statutory trigger for funding cuts to pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut.  

This is a Trojan horse strategy for achieving what they couldn't with their failed ACA repeal.  It will slash Medicaid, Medicare, and other critical services that all the rest of us depend on.  

[Sen. Chuck **Schumer**](https://www.schumer.senate.gov/) said*, "This is the **worst bill** anyone has ever seen. This will change America. Government will have no money. **Medicare, Medicaid, EPA, food stamps, education, infrastructure and other programs will be slashed**. Taxes will increase for the middle class. The economy will be disrupted."   He said that these cuts are **in addition** to another, specifically-targeted **$1 trillion cut to Medicare and Medicaid**.

We must **block the bill** at every stage of the process!

We need your help to **mobilize progressives in key red states** and districts to pressure their Senators and Representatives **to vote "No" on tax cuts** for the rich and to **protect funding for Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and other programs**. "
