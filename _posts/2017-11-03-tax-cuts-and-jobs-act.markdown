"Today, House Republican leaders released their draft tax code overhaul that would give the wealthiest people and corporations giant tax breaks which, in turn, set in motion a statutory trigger for funding cuts to pay for the $1.5 trillion tax cut.  

This is a Trojan horse strategy for achieving what they couldn't with their failed ACA repeal.  It will slash Medicaid, Medicare, and other critical services that all the rest of us depend on.  

Sen. Chuck Schumer said*, "This is the worst bill anyone has ever seen. This will change America. Government will have no money. Medicare, Medicaid, EPA, food stamps, education, infrastructure and other programs will be slashed. Taxes will increase for the middle class. The economy will be disrupted."   He said that these cuts are in addition to another, specifically-targeted $1 trillion cut to Medicare and Medicaid.

We must block the bill at every stage of the process!

We need your help to mobilize progressives in key red states and districts to pressure their Senators and Representatives to vote "No" on tax cuts for the rich and to protect funding for Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security and other programs. "
