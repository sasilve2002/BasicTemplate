Republican leaders just emerged from a 5-hour closed-door meeting where they finalized their tax "plan," and now Trump is about to go onstage in Indiana to sell it to the nation.

No matter what Trump is about to say, here's the truth:

The only people the Republicans are trying to help are the rich and massive corporations -- despite new polls showing that 65% of Americans think corporate tax rates are too low and 62% oppose tax cuts for the rich.

Here's what to expect from Trump's speech describing the tax plan:

*Massive tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, disguised as "simplifying" the tax code

*Tax giveaways to big corporations, camouflaged as "cutting taxes for small businesses" (the vast majority of which already pay the lowest-possible tax rate)

*A tax hike for the lowest tax bracket (aka those who can afford an increase in taxes the LEAST)
