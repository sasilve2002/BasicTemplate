Excerpted from [Tax March](http://taxmarch.org/) :

"    **Republican** leaders just emerged from a 5-hour **closed-door** meeting where they finalized their tax "plan," and now Trump is about to go onstage in **Indiana** to sell it to the nation.

No matter what Trump is about to say, **here's the truth**:

The only people the Republicans are trying to help are the **rich and massive corporations** -- despite new polls showing that 65% of Americans think corporate tax rates are too low and 62% oppose tax cuts for the rich.

Here's what to expect from Trump's speech describing the tax plan:

***Massive tax cuts for the wealthiest** Americans, disguised as "simplifying" the tax code

***Tax giveaways to big corporations**, camouflaged as "cutting taxes for small businesses" (the vast majority of which already pay the lowest-possible tax rate)

*A **tax hike for the lowest tax bracket** (aka those who can afford an increase in taxes the LEAST)

That's why we need to make sure they hear **our voices loud and clear**.
