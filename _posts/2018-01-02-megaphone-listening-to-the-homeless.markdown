Excerpted from the [Women's March Oakland]'s "[Megaphone](https://womensmarchoakland.org/the-megaphone)": 

"  Ever see a homeless person and feel an enormous sense of helplessness? Have you ever wondered how you - just one person - could make a difference? "

"  Join [WMO [Women's March Oakland]](https://womensmarchoakland.org/about-the-march/) and Spirit of Oakland as we "Walk a Mile" by learning empathetic listening tools. Popular Storytelling host Ted Lee will set the stage as people living in encampments share their stories. We will dine and learn how we can make a difference. Tickets are $20 and proceeds go to The Village in Oakland & Alpha Omega Foundation.) :
