**DEMAND CONGRESS FORMALLY CENSURE TRUMP FOR HIS RACIST COMMENTS**

"  As the nation celebrates the birthday of **Dr. Martin Luther King**, the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus **Rep. [Cedric Richmond](https://richmond.house.gov/)** (D-LA) and **[Rep. Jerry Nadler](https://nadler.house.gov/)** (D-NY) will be **introducing** an unprecedented **[second censure** resolution of Donald Trump](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/369022-house-dem-trump-censure-resolution-meant-to-put-congress-on-record). This time it will be for his racist comments in the Oval Office regarding American immigration policy.  "

"  Until the election of Donald Trump, presidential censures were extremely rare and have only been used a handful of times in congressional history. **Members of Congress must speak out** in unison to formally denounce Trump's racist and dishonorable behavior. "
