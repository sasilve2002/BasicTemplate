Excerpted from [Weekly Actions to Resist Trump](http://www.weekly-resistance.online/about.html):

"  ...join us in demanding Congress pass the BRIDGE Act ASAP. “Dreamers,” who got legal protection from deportation under Obama, are especially vulnerable to Trump. Members of both parties are co-sponsoring this legislation to let them keep their protected status and to stop Trump from using their confidential information against them.  "

[Click here for the action](http://www.weekly-resistance.online/).
