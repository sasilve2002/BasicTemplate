Excerpted from [**5 Calls**](https://5calls.org/issue/pressure-governors-support-chip) :

"  While **Republicans** in Congress focus on ramming through their **unpopular tax plan**, two critical sources of **healthcare** for vulnerable Americans are still **awaiting funding reauthorization**. On September 30th, funding expired for both the [**Childrenâ€™s Health Insurance Program**](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/childrens-health-insurance-program-chip/) and the [**Community Health Centers Fund**](http://www.nachc.org/policy-matters/federal-issues/appropriations/).  "

***MESSAGE TO GOVERNORS: PRESSURE CONGRESS TO FUND CHIP AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS***

[***Clilck here to email Governor Brown***](https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov39mail/).  Under "PLEASE CHOOSE YOUR SUBJECT," choose "Health and Services Agency".

**Sample Script**:

***I am a constituent from Oakland [zip].
I'm writing to encourage Governor Brown to join the bipartisan group of governors pressuring Congress to pass a clean CHIP funding reauthorization bill. I also urge the governor to advocate for renewal of the Community Health Centers Fund. Both programs provide critical healthcare access to some of the most vulnerable residents of California**.*

***Thank you for your time, and Happy New Year!***

***Sincerely**,

**[*Your name*}**
