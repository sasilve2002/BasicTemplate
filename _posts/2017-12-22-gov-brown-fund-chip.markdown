Excerpted from [**5 Calls**](https://5calls.org/issue/pressure-governors-support-chip) :

***MESSAGE TO GOVERNORS: PRESSURE CONGRESS TO FUND CHIP AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS***

[***Clilck here to email Governor Brown***](https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov39mail/).

**Sample Script**:

*I am a constituent from Oakland [zip].
I'm writing to encourage Governor [NAME] to join the bipartisan group of governors pressuring Congress to pass a clean CHIP funding reauthorization bill. I also urge the governor to advocate for renewal of the Community Health Centers Fund. Both programs provide critical healthcare access to some of the most vulnerable residents of California.

*Thank you for your time, and Happy New Year!*

*Sincerely,
[Your name}*
