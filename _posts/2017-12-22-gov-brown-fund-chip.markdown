***MESSAGE TO GOVERNORS: PRESSURE CONGRESS TO FUND CHIP AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS***

[***Clilck here to email Governor Brown***](https://govapps.gov.ca.gov/gov39mail/).

Sample Script:

I am a constituent from Oakland [zip].
I'm writing to encourage Governor [NAME] to join the bipartisan group of governors pressuring Congress to pass a clean CHIP funding reauthorization bill. I also urge the governor to advocate for renewal of the Community Health Centers Fund. Both programs provide critical healthcare access to some of the most vulnerable residents of our state.

Thank you for your time, and Happy New Year!

Sincerely,
[Your name}
