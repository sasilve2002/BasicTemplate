Excerpted from [Tom Steyer's **Need to Impeach**](https://www.needtoimpeach.com/call-to-protect/?utm_source=sp12728545&utm_medium=email&sc=sp12728545&refcode=sp12728545&p2asource=sp12728545&ta=0):

"[Devin **Nunes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devin_Nunes), the [Intelligence Committee](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/)'s chairman -- with [Paul **Ryan**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan)'s backing -- is making moves to **shut down** the House Intelligence Committee's **Russia investigation**."
