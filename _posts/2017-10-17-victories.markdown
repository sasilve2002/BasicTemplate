Excerpted from [**The League of Women Voters**](https://lwvc.org/) :

The [**2017 California legislative session**](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/14/liveblog-california-legislature-takes-on-big-bills-in-end-of-session-crunch/) is a wrap, and **thanks to you**, we have **new laws** addressing many of the critical issues we face in California. Because so many of you took action, **we’re celebrating major legislative victories**:

-- [**The California Values Act**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB54) passed, ensuring state and local resources are not being used to fuel mass deportations, destroy families, and cripple our economy. 

-- The passage of [**SB 2**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB2) and [**SB 3**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB3) will generate about $5 billion for more **affordable housing** over the next five years. 
 
-- **Campaign ads** will have to identify their **big money donors** prominently on tv, radio, online, and in print with the passage of the [**Disclose Act**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249).

-- **Community college students** will be assessed more fairly, creating a **clearer path** to success and preventing them from being tracked into unnecessary non-credit remedial classes thanks to [**AB 705**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB705).

-- The passage of [**AB 918**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB918) means the millions of **voters** with limited English skills will **have access** to more information in their **language**, including facsimile ballots—a critical step in ensuring **all voices are heard on election day**. 

In addition to the many action alerts we sent, the League was also advocating for other bills at the Capitol. This year, Governor **Brown signed ALL of the bills supported by the League** that came across his desk! California now has 27 new League-approved laws, improving California’s policies on the **environment, education, voting rights, and more.**

Unfortunately, our efforts to reform California’s **broken bail system were stalled**, but we’ll have another chance to fix that when [**SB 10**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB10) is taken up again next year. We’re also looking forward to ongoing efforts to address the **housing shortage and progress on key higher education bills**. The League is also ready to take action on **campaign finance reform** and any legislative responses to new federal activity. 

**Thank you again for speaking up!**   

Sincerely,

Helen Hutchison
President, LWVC

P.S. The **legislature will be back in January**, and we’re already hard at work. Help us make change: please follow us on Twitter and Facebook, join the League, or contribute.  "

And there's **more** (thanks, Alegra!):
 [**SB 649**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB649) would have given vast new power to the **telecom industry** by allowing them to **put cell phone towers** pretty much **anywhere** they wanted, without reimbursement for use of public land, and would have taken away the power of local & county governments to regulate them. It passed in the legislature, but was **vetoed by Gov. Brown**.
