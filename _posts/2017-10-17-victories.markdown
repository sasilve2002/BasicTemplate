Excerpted from [**The League of Women Voters**](https://lwvc.org/) :

The [2017 California legislative session](http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/09/14/liveblog-california-legislature-takes-on-big-bills-in-end-of-session-crunch/) is a wrap, and **thanks to you**, we have **new laws** addressing many of the critical issues we face in California. Because so many of you took action, **we’re celebrating major legislative victories**:

-- The **California Values Act passed**, ensuring state and local resources are not being used to fuel mass deportations, destroy families, and cripple our economy. 

-- The passage of **SB 2 and SB 3** will generate about $5 billion for more **affordable housing** over the next five years. 
 
-- **Campaign ads** will have to identify their **big money donors** prominently on tv, radio, online, and in print with the passage of the **Disclose Act**.

-- **Community college students** will be assessed more fairly, creating a **clearer path** to success and preventing them from being tracked into unnecessary non-credit remedial classes thanks to **AB 705**.

-- The passage of **AB 918** means the millions of **voters** with limited English skills will **have access** to more information in their **language**, including facsimile ballots—a critical step in ensuring **all voices are heard on election day**. 

In addition to the many action alerts we sent, the League was also advocating for other bills at the Capitol. This year, Governor **Brown signed ALL of the bills supported by the League** that came across his desk! California now has 27 new League-approved laws, improving California’s policies on the **environment, education, voting rights, and more.**

Unfortunately, our efforts to reform California’s **broken bail system were stalled**, but we’ll have another chance to fix that when **SB 10** is taken up again next year. We’re also looking forward to ongoing efforts to address the **housing shortage and progress on key higher education bills**. The League is also ready to take action on **campaign finance reform** and any legislative responses to new federal activity. 

**Thank you again for speaking up!**   

Sincerely,

Helen Hutchison
President, LWVC

P.S. The **legislature will be back in January**, and we’re already hard at work. Help us make change: please follow us on Twitter and Facebook, join the League, or contribute.  "
