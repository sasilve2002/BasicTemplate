 **& Harris : (415) 355-9041**
 
and **Representative Lee : (510) 763-0370.**"

**Sample Script**: 

"*Hi.  My name is ____________ and I’m from [ZIP].  I am **concerned** about allowing states to impose **lifetime caps on Medicaid coverage**. I don’t understand why congressional Republicans are **shredding the social safety net**. I want my taxes to provide **medical care to my vulnerable neighbors**. **I oppose Medicaid work-for-service and lifetime caps**. Tell me, how is [*Feinstein , Harris , Lee*] protecting our own citizens’ medical needs?*"
