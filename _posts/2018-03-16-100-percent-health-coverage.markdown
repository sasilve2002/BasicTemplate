"Improving access to health care in California, and **moving beyond** the debate over repealing the **ACA** to the **work that still needs to be done**."

"The [**Care4All California campaign**](http://care4allca.org/) is committed to ensuring that **California** has **100% health coverage**, as well as improving quality, affordability, and equity in our health system."

**Universal Coverage**
Regardless of immigration status, age, disability, income, or other factors.

**Affordable coverage** ...so no Californian pays more than a percentage of their income for their premium, on a sliding scale, and lower co-pays and deductibles too.

**Cost-effective coverage** that improves health outcomes and reduces disparities.  Care is focused on value, quality and equity for patients, rather than profits.

**Public coverage options**
Determined by public policy and accountability rather than the whims of private insurers.
