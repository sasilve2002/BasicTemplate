Excerpted from [**care4allca.org**](http://care4allca.org/) :

"Improving access to health care in California, and **moving beyond** the debate over repealing the **ACA** to the **work that still needs to be done**."

"The [**Care4All California campaign**](http://care4allca.org/) is committed to ensuring that **California** has **100% health coverage**, as well as improving quality, affordability, and equity in our health system."

Universal Coverage
Regardless of immigration status, age, disability, income, or other factors.

Affordable coverage ... so no Californian pays more than a percentage of their income for their premium, on a sliding scale, and lower co-pays and deductibles too.

Cost-effective coverage that improves health outcomes and reduces disparities
Care is focused on value, quality and equity for patients, rather than profits.

Public coverage options
Determined by public policy and accountability rather than the whims of private insurers.
