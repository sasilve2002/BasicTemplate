Excerpted from [**MARCH FOR OUR LIVES**](https://www.marchforourlives.com/).

"On **March 24**, the kids and families of **March For Our Lives** will take to the streets of Washington DC to demand that their lives and safety become a priority and that we end gun violence and mass shootings in our schools today."

"Instead of crying they are speaking. Instead of mourning they are protesting. And instead of waiting, the children of Stoneman Douglas High School are begging for our help."

"We must stand with them and #MarchForOurLives"
