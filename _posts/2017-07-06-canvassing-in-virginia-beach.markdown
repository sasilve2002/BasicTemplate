If you are able to **travel to Virginia** for the **2018** races, the **Sister District Project** is developing a plan -- let me know (**510-338-0831**, **sasilve2002@gmail.com**) if any of you are interested and I will connect you -- 

From Andrea @ our local Sister District Project:

"  I would really like to promote some work Melanie is doing.  First, she is gathering 5 **canvassers** from each group.  it's mostly a **training** exercise at this point because in **2018** we will most likely have a race close to home but if there is anyone who would like to go to **Virginia Beach**, that would be great.  By 'like' I mean they don't hate the idea, it's not a commitment.  "
