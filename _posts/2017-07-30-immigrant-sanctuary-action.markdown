Last month the House passed the No Sanctuary For Criminals Act and Kate's Law. The No Sanctuary for Criminals Act forces communities to devote local resources to enforce federal immigration law and penalizes them if they don’t comply. [insert unconstitutional argument here]. Kate’s Law increases penalties on immigrants for reentry.

Both bills have passed the House and are moving quickly (and under the radar) through the Senate. All-of-us remind our senators that immigrants make America great and convince them to oppose these bills.
