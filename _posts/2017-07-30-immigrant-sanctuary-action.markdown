Excerpted from [Wall-Of-Us](http:/https://www.wallofus.org/) :

"  Last month the House passed the **No Sanctuary For Criminals Act** and **Kate's Law**. 

The **No Sanctuary** for Criminals Act **forces communities to devote local resources to enforce federal immigration** law and penalizes them if they don’t comply. 

**Kate’s Law** increases **penalties** on immigrants for **reentry**.

Both bills have passed the House and are **moving quickly** (and under the radar) through the **Senate**. Remind our senators that immigrants make America great and convince them to oppose these bills.

**Call Senators Feinstein (202-224-3841) & Harris (202-224-3553)** and use the **script** below:

*Hi. I’m (NAME) from (Town, California). I’m calling to ask **Senator** [**Feinstein**/**Harris**] to do everything she can to **oppose** the two punitive and unnecessary anti-immigrant bills unfairly passed in the House and moving to the Senate. The **No Sanctuary for Criminals Act** forces communities to **devote local resources to enforcing federal immigration** law and penalizes them if they don’t comply. This legislation would tie up the valuable resources we desperately need to protect the residents of our city. **Kate’s Law** increases **penalties on immigrants for reentry**, a failed strategy that would explode the prison population and cost billions of dollars. These bills offer only discredited approaches that will result in even more pain for immigrants. I urge the Senator to strongly **oppose No Sanctuary For Criminals Act and Kate’s Law**.*
