Excerpted from [Wall-Of-Us](http:/https://www.wallofus.org/) :

"  Last month the House passed the **No Sanctuary For Criminals Act** and **Kate's Law**. 

The **No Sanctuary** for Criminals Act **forces communities to devote local resources to enforce federal immigration** law and penalizes them if they don’t comply. 

**Kate’s Law** increases **penalties** on immigrants for **reentry**.

Both bills have passed the House and are **moving quickly** (and under the radar) through the **Senate**. Remind our senators that immigrants make America great and convince them to oppose these bills.

**Call Senators Feinstein (202-224-3841) & Harris (202-224-3553)** and use the **script** below:

*Hi. I’m (NAME) from (Town, California). I’m calling to ask Senator [Feinstein/Harris] to do everything she can to **oppose** the two punitive and unnecessary anti-immigrant bills unfairly passed in the House and moving to the Senate. The **No Sanctuary for Criminals Act** forces communities to devote local resources to enforcing federal immigration law and penalizes them if they don’t comply. This legislation would tie up the valuable resources we desperately need to protect the residents of our city. **Kate’s Law** increases penalties on immigrants for reentry, a failed strategy that **would explode the prison population and cost billions of dollars**. These bills offer only discredited approaches that will result in even more pain for immigrants. I urge the Senator to strongly **oppose No Sanctuary For Criminals Act and Kate’s Law**.*
