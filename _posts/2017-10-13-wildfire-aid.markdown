From a **very generous neighbor** who is gathering supplies and driving them up to Santa Rosa - 

If you have anything to **donate, drop off at**:

"  **5061 Parkridge Drive** or leave in door way if no one is home. You can also send me an email at **annesophie.breuning@gmail.com** and I can come pick up items from your house.   "


**Here's a List of Needs**:
- New Underwear :
: women's - m & l - cotton simple
: men's - large - cotton simple
: kids - size 6-10 - cotton

- Pads and tampons
- Travel size shampoo, conditioner, and soap
- New toothbrushes
- Toothpaste
- bubbles
- playing cards
- stickers/sticker workbooks
- pencils
- notepads for writing/drawing
- Towels
- Razors
- Duffel bags, backpacks
- Socks
- Granola Bars
- Sweatpants

"  Keep things portable as there is limited space and no arts/crafts area per se. Also, if you know how to do magic, teach yoga, play music there is a need for activities being led for adults + kids.  "

"  You can connect directly with any of the shelters listed here: https:[//docs.google.com/document/d/14ZhXDNaL260p5OempaFbCrsYBe_5pvNvDqV7xcwn95s/preview]  "
