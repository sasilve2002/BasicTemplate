Excerpted from an email from a **very generous neighbor** who is **gathering supplies** and getting them **up north to shelters** - 

If you have anything to **donate, drop off at**:

"  **5061 Parkridge Drive** or leave in door way if no one is home. You can also send me an email at **annesophie.breuning@gmail.com** and I can come pick up items from your house.   "


**Here's a List of Needs**:
- New Underwear :
: women's - m & l - cotton simple
: men's - large - cotton simple
: kids - size 6-10 - cotton

- Pads and tampons

- notepads for writing/drawing

"  Keep things **portable** as there is **limited space** and no arts/crafts area per se. **Also, if you know how to do magic, teach yoga, play music there is a need for activities being led for adults + kids.**  "
