## From Anne Sophie Hurst, a neighbor who is gathering supplies and driving them up to Santa Rosa - 

Here's a List of Needs:

- New underwear:

--- Women's - m & l - cotton simple
--- Men's - large - cotton simple
--- Kids - size 6-10 - cotton
- Pads and tampons
- Travel size shampoo, conditioner, and soap
- New toothbrushes
- Toothpaste
- bubbles
- playing cards
- stickers/sticker workbooks
- pencils
- notepads for writing/drawing

Keep things portable as there is limited space and no arts/crafts area per se. Also, if you know how to do magic, teach yoga, play music there is a need for activities being led for adults + kids.
