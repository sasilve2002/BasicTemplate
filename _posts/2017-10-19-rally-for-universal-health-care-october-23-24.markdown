Excerpted from [**State Strong California**](https://www.facebook.com/CAStateStrong/) :

**"**   California has the potential to enact **universal health care** with [**SB 562**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562), the important (but admittedly incomplete) **Medicare-for-all bill** that was halted in committee this past year. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon has called for a select committee to discuss the bill and California’s prospects for universal health care. Because who knew that health care is complicated?
