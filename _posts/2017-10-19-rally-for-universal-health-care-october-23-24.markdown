Excerpted from [**State Strong California**](https://www.facebook.com/CAStateStrong/) :

California has the potential to enact universal health care with [**SB 562**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB562), the important (but admittedly incomplete) Medicare-for-all bill that was halted in committee this past year. Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon has called for a select committee to discuss the bill and California’s prospects for universal health care. Because who knew that health care is complicated? Healthy CA and the California Nurses Association will host a rally in Sacramento during the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, October 23–24.
