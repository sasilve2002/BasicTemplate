"    Take a deep breath.

Let out a good sigh.

And repeat after us: YOU JUST DEFEATED TRUMPCARE. AGAIN!

You did it. You did it! Your relentless, tenacious, bold organizing just defeated the latest version of TrumpCare.

After you threw down and stopped “skinny repeal” in July, Republicans strolled into the month of September thinking they were in the clear and that they could bribe other Senators, whip votes, and pass Graham-Cassidy without you noticing. They. Were. WRONG.

You showed up at their offices. Again. You made calls to your senators. Again. You defeated this bill that everyone thought was a foregone conclusion on Day 1 of the Trump Administration. AGAIN. This is your victory.

In just the last week:

2,233 Indivisible volunteers across the country dialed 320,552 times using our Calls to Kill TrumpCare tool to encourage constituents in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, and Colorado to call their Republican senators. That’s 61,680 minutes (or 42.8 days!) of call time!

You visited our TrumpCareTen.org resources, call scripts, and contact information to put pressure on your senators over 201,000 times.
You hosted 172 events across the nation at congressional district offices over the course of the week to continue pressuring your members of Congress and for yesterday’s National Day of Action to #KillTheBill.

Last Friday, signs of a possible victory began to appear as Senator John McCain of Arizona came out against Graham-Cassidy. He was joined by Senator Susan Collins of Maine yesterday afternoon. And just an hour ago, Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana (the latest TrumpCare bill co-sponsors) announced they do not have the votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act before the Senate’s September 30th reconciliation deadline.

This is a major victory for the more 6,000 Indivisible groups and tens of thousands of people in the Indivisible movement. You continue to show that, even with a unified conservative government, attempts to strip millions of people of their health care will be stopped by constituents exercising their power (contacting Members of Congress by making phone calls, writing letters, and showing up day after day to make your concerns heard).

**This fight isn’t over. While we’re celebrating victory today, we know that Republicans won’t abandon their mission to dismantle our health care system. Here’s what we know right now**:

The Trump Administration is deliberately sabotaging the Affordable Care Act by reducing the window for Open Enrollment, slashing the outreach budget, putting out anti-ACA propaganda, cutting assistance to local organizations who assist people in enrolling for health care, and deliberately turning off healthcare.gov during Open Enrollment.

Majority Leader Mitch McConnell now has two choices. He can restart the bipartisan approach to a short-term stabilization bill that Senators Alexander and Murray began earlier this month. Or he can try to bring back zombie TrumpCare -- again -- by combining it with the Trump Tax Scam as part of the Fiscal Year 2018 budget process.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for everything you’ve done to build this movement. We don’t know when or if Mitch McConnell, Paul Ryan, and the rest of the GOP will attempt to revive TrumpCare. We do know we’ll have more fights to fight. But for today, we celebrate. Today, we’re proud to stand indivisible with you and have you standing indivisible with us.

If you marched, protested, called, or -- yes -- donated to Indivisible, you own today’s victory. This belongs to all of us.

In solidarity and victory,
The Indivisible Team    "
