Generation Z is the generation after the millennials, born between 1998 and 2016. Progressive Gen Zers turning 18 before November 6th can give all-of-us a gift this year by voting! Most Gen Zers, however, don’t know that they have to pre-register to be eligible to vote on election day because voter education is often overlooked by many high schools. That’s why we must advocate to our school boards, who represent all-of-us. Don’t forget that school board members make up the largest body of elected officials in the US. Whether or not we have children, we have entrusted these board members to set the strategic vision and policies for our schools. We must make sure that civic education is a core part of that vision. This week, all-of-us must school our schools to ensure that Gen Zers don’t hit snooze on November 6th.
