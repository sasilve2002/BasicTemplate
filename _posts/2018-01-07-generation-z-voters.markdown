Excerpted from [**Wall of Us**](https://www.wallofus.org/)  :

"  **Generation Z** is the generation after the millennials, born between **1998 and 2016**. Progressive Gen Zers turning **18 before November 6th** can give all-of-us a gift this year by voting! 

Most **Gen Zers**, however, don’t know that they have to **pre-register** to be eligible to vote on election day because voter education is often overlooked by many high schools. 

That’s why we must **advocate** to our **school boards**, who represent all-of-us. Don’t forget that school board members make up the largest body of elected officials in the US. Whether or not we have children, we have entrusted these board members to set the strategic vision and policies for our schools. We must make sure that **civic education** is a core part of that vision. **This week**, all-of-us must school our schools to ensure that **Gen Zers** don’t hit snooze on **November 6th**.

[**California** :	**16- and 17-year-olds** may **preregister **to vote in any election that occurs on or after their **18th birthday**.	](Cal. Elec. Code §§ 2000(b), 2102(d), 2102a, 2107, 2196 (West); 2009 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 364, § 7 (A.B. 30) (West).)

If you are a **parent of a child in high school**, contact your **[school’s administration](https://www.ousd.org/)** and confirm that they will have a **voter education event** that includes voter **pre-registration**.

[**Call your local school board**](http://mapgis.oaklandnet.com/ousd/) (you don’t have to be a parent to do this) and **confirm** that schools in your district are **prioritizing voter education** and especially **voter pre-registration**.
