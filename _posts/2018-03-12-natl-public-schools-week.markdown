Excerpted from [**The Network or Public Education**](https://networkforpubliceducation.org/) : 

"Thanks to the efforts of many led by the [**American Association of School Administrators (AASA)**](https://ballotpedia.org/American_Association_of_School_Administrators), this week (March 12 - 16) will be National Public Schools Week. A bipartisan group of members of Congress whom you can find here are co-chairing this event.
