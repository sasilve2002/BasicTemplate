Excerpted from [**The Network or Public Education**](https://networkforpubliceducation.org/) : 

"Thanks to the efforts of many led by the [**American Association of School Administrators (AASA)**](https://ballotpedia.org/American_Association_of_School_Administrators), this week (**March 12 - 16**) will be **National Public Schools Week**. A bipartisan group of [**members of Congress whom you can find here**](http://lovepubliceducation.org/public-schools-week-toolkit/?link_id=0&can_id=e59665c3f3c1222626c02430d1bf6bdb&source=email-public-schools-week-a-new-npe-report-and-results-from-our-survey-on-gun-violence-2&email_referrer=email_315802&email_subject=public-schools-week-a-new-npe-report-and-results-from-our-survey-on-gun-violence) are co-chairing this event.

An educated America is a better America. Want a stronger America? Improve public education.  All children have the right to a public education that prepares them for college, careers and citizenship.  Educated citizens make better neighbors. They bring income and taxes into the community. They are healthier. They are more likely to vote.
