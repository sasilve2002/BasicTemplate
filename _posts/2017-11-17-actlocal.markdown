Excerpted from [**ActLocal East Bay**](http://www.actlocal2017.org/) :

"   Join [**ActLocal2017**](http://www.actlocal2017.org/) in Oakland, as we bring together leaders from new and established **progressive organizations** across the East Bay for a day of **networking, learning and inspiration**. This invitation-only summit will feature dynamic keynotes, targeted workshops, and interactive sessions to develop and amplify campaigns that will help prepare us for 2018 local, state, and federal elections.   "

"  Our goal is to build **local progressive power** by:

**-** **Sustaining**, supporting, and connecting new and established progressive leaders;

**-** **Identifying** near-term campaigns that can be fought and won at a local level;

**-** **Supporting** cross-movement collaboration, coordination and innovation through a shared calendar, directory, and network;

**-** **Creating** electoral power by building awareness of local election cycles and timetables.  "
