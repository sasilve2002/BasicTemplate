Excerpted from [California Clean Money Action Fund](http://www.cacleanaction.org/) :

[AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249) passed the legislature in overwhelming bipartisan votes and is now on the way to the Governor's desk!

When he decides whether to sign [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249), the Governor is likely to look at what is said by the [Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC)](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/), responsible for administering and enforcing disclosure laws.  The [FPPC](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/) will decide whether to support or oppose [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249) in its hearing on Thursday.

We need public comments telling the [FPPC](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/) to support [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249) — just like every single good government group that's taken a position does, including California Clean Money Campaign, [California Common Cause](http://www.commoncause.org/states/california/about/?referrer=https://www.google.com/), [CALPIRG](http://www.calpirg.org/home), the [League of Women Voters of California](https://lwvc.org/), [Maplight](https://maplight.org/), [Money Out Voters In](http://www.moneyoutvotersin.org/), and more.  We all demand [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249), the strongest disclosure law in the nation.

RIGHT NOW, PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION that emails the [FPPC](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/) and asks them to support [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249), the California DISCLOSE Act — to strike a major blow against the unlimited secret money unleashed by Citizens United.
