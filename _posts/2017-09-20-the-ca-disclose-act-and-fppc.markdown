Excerpted from [**California Clean Money Action Fund**](http://www.cacleanaction.org/) :

[**AB 249**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249) **passed the legislature** in overwhelming **bipartisan** votes and is now on the way to the **Governor's desk**!

When he decides whether to sign [**AB 249**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249), the Governor is likely to look at what is said by the [**Fair Political Practices Commission** (**FPPC**)](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/), responsible for administering and enforcing disclosure laws.  The [**FPPC**](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/) will decide whether to support or oppose [**AB 249**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249) in its **hearing on Thursday**.

We need **public comments** telling the [**FPPC**](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/) to support [**AB 249**](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249) — just like every single good government group that's taken a position does, including [**California Clean Money Campaign**](http://www.cacleanaction.org/), [**California Common Cause**](http://www.commoncause.org/states/california/about/?referrer=https://www.google.com/), [**CALPIRG**](http://www.calpirg.org/home), the [**League of Women Voters of California**](https://lwvc.org/), [**Maplight**](https://maplight.org/), [Money Out Voters In](http://www.moneyoutvotersin.org/), and more.  We all demand [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249), the strongest disclosure law in the nation.

RIGHT NOW, PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION that emails the [FPPC](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/) and asks them to support [AB 249](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB249), the California DISCLOSE Act — to strike a major blow against the unlimited secret money unleashed by [Citizens United](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._FEC).
