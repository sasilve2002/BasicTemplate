"  To: [Senator Dianne **Feinstein**](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/)
From: Indivisible East Bay and Indivisible San Francisco
Date: December 8, 2017
Subject: The **DREAM Act Pledge**

Senator **Feinstein** cast the **wrong vote**, but she has another chance to fight for **DREAMers**

Last night, Senator **Feinstein** disappointed her constituents by voting to **leave DREAMers hanging in limbo** for two more weeks. While Republicans have been dismantling health care and pushing their tax scam, Senator Feinstein agreed to a two-week continuing resolution to keep the government running—**without demanding anything in return**.

Senator **Harris** and most House Democrats **voted NO** on the two-week extension of government funding, **because it doesn't include much-needed protections for DACA youth**. More of these young people are losing their status every day, and all of them are living in fear of losing it soon. **Each day's delay means 122 immigrants lose their work permits**. By December 22, that's 1,708 more young men and women **forced back into the shadows**.

And when they do put these protections in place, we expect all our representatives to make sure that they aren’t paid for with increased persecution of their parents and other immigrants, border walls, and more detention centers.

Senator Feinstein knows we should have passed a clean DREAM Act months ago (years ago, really). She knows there are enough votes in both houses to pass the bill, but the only way Republican leadership will let it through is if Democrats demand it of them.

To make the DREAM Act law, **Democrats need to demonstrate their strength**. The **senators from California**, who represent nearly a **third of DACA recipients**, must demonstrate to Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell—not just with words or Tweets, but with votes—that **if they want to deport 800,000 young people, who want nothing more than to contribute their energy and talent to their home country—along with $433 billion to the national GDP—they will have to shut down the government to do it!**

Senator Feinstein, please remember: **No Dream-No Deal**.  "
