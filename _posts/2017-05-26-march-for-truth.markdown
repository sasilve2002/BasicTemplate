A **Rally** **Saturday, June 3**, 2017, for [March for Truth](https://www.facebook.com/MarchforTruthSanFrancisco/) (https://www.eventbrite.com/e/march-for-truth-tickets-34681337815) is scheduled in SF, which you have to sign up for through [eventbrite.](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/march-for-truth-tickets-34681337815)  There's also one in

Congress is now in **recess** week of Memorial Day. There are marches scheduled around the country. If you haven't had a chance to join in a march against Twitter Twit's **HARMFUL AGENDA**, try this one - grab a friend and take a scenic drive:

From the **March For Truth** organizers:

**"**We call for a [#MarchForTruth](https://www.marchfortruth.info/) on **Saturday, June 3rd** to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that Americans want answers. The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency.**"**

The **location** and **starting time** of this event is likely to **change**; potentially an hour earlier than planned. This is not a march. This is a rally in support of the national effort.
