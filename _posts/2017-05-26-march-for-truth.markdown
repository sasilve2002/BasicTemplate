Congress is in **recess** beginning Memorial Day. There are marches scheduled around the country - closest one to us is in Sacramento. If you haven't had a chance to join in a march against Twitter Twit's **HARMFUL AGENDA**, try this one - grab a friend and take a scenic drive:

From the **March For Truth** organizers:

"We call for a [#MarchForTruth](https://www.marchfortruth.info/) on **Saturday, June 3rd** to raise our voices and let our elected leaders know that Americans want answers. The legitimacy of our democracy is more important than the interests of any party, or any President. So, we will rise together to call for a fair and impartial investigation, for the pursuit of truth, and for the restoration of faith in our electoral system and the Office of the Presidency."

The closest one to us is:
