A little **moral support** for this **young immigrant**:

Excerpted from [Jen Hofman's "Weekly Action Checklist for Democrats, Independents, and Republicans of Conscience"](https://jenniferhofmann.com/home/weekly-action-checklist-democrats-independents-republicans-conscience/)
 
**Action**: Send a postcard to a special young man.
Nestor is a 27-year-old DREAMer who has been at Stewart Detention Center in Georgia for nine months. Originally from South Carolina, he was full of life, a 5K runner, and a college graduate with honors. Now he is in medical detention, feeling lonely and scared. Nestorâ€™s loving parents are not able to visit. While he awaits news about his health and his future in the US, let Nestor know he matters with a kind, colorful, encouraging, or funny postcard. (**No money or gifts. Just hugs via mail**.)
 
**Address**: 

Nestor Daniel Avila Miranda
