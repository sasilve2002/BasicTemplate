Excerpted from [**Trent Lange**](www.YesFairElections.org):

"  **Great news**!  Today, **AB 249** officially got its **new author**, as Senate President pro Tem **Kevin de Leon**'s Senate Rules Committee officially granted AB 249 its requested author -- Clean Money Champion Assemblymember **Kevin Mullin**! 

Thanks to everybody who helped make that happen, including the **12,000 people who emailed**, the **1,500 people who called**, and the **28 of you who came to Sacramento** on short notice waving signs and lobbying Rules Committee members offices! 

AB 249 still has a long way to go, but this was an important victory, so thanks to everybody who helped make it happen! "
