Excerpted from [Senator **Kamala Harris**](https://www.harris.senate.gov/) :

"   What’s happening in [**Puerto Rico**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico) is a humanitarian crisis.

[**Hurricane Maria**](https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/hurricane-maria-us-east-coast-forecast) has devastated the island, **killing at least 16** -- and 44% of [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico)’s 3.5 million residents are still **without clean drinking water**.

[**Puerto Ricans are Americans**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico), and it’s up to us to help them while there’s still time to make a difference. We can’t ignore their suffering. So I’m asking:

Can you [**make a contribution**](https://campaigns.organizefor.org/petitions/help-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria?akid=7955.3385891.9TBZXO&bucket=COC&rd=1&source=mailing&t=4) to aid our brothers, sisters, and friends in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria? Your donation will support local nonprofits working to address this crisis.

In the aftermath of the destruction of **Hurricanes Harvey and Irma**, our grassroots team stepped up, raising over **$200,000** to support relief efforts in the communities that were devastated by these hurricanes.

We proved that, during times of crisis, we are stronger when we come together and lift each other up.

The devastation seen in [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico) is heartbreaking.

Thanks for all you do.

Kamala Harris
U.S. Senator, California    "
