**Agenda** (updated):  

**1**. Bring your favorite writing implements - I have 50 addresses to write to **South Carolina** :  

The election is **SC-05** [where Archie Parnell just won the Democratic primary ](https://ballotpedia.org/Archie_Parnell).  The seat was vacated when Mick Mulvaney (R) was confirmed as director of the US Office of Management and Budget.  The general election is on June 20, 2017, and we'll be writing to remind **blue South Caroliners** to vote.

I have stamps and USPS postcards, but if you have blank postcards, please bring them :)

**2**. We'll sign up for various resistance sites.

**3**. Upcoming marches & events

Please feel free to **bring friends, family, neighbors** to our meetings - each new contact is a success for resisting the Twitter Twit.  You are protecting our democracy in spite of **Twit's insane distractions**.
