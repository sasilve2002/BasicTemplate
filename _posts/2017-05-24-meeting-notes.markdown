**Meeting Notes**:

We welcomed two folks from “[Sidewalk Talk](http://www.sidewalktalksf.com/)” who graciously demonstrated how they **LISTEN**:  one spoke her confusion & frustration over her support of Trump  while the other just sat and really listened with sympathetic acceptance.  It was an uplifting demonstration.
