**Meeting Notes**:

We welcomed two folks, Travia & Myisha, from “[Sidewalk Talk](http://www.sidewalktalksf.com/)” who graciously demonstrated how they **LISTEN**:  one spoke her confusion & frustration over her support of Trump  while the other just sat and really listened with sympathetic acceptance.  It was an uplifting demonstration. 
 
We reviewed use of our **website**:  
- Actions are posted almost daily, so check in often.
- Everyone is invited to add to the website - just email/phone/text me (no personal info because it is a public site).

We looked at **upcoming marches** : 
[National Gun Violence Awareness Day](https://everytown.org/) (National: June 2nd) - “Wear Orange Golden Gate Bridge March” - SF, June 3.
[Equality March](http://equalitymarch2017.org) – June 11th, LBTQ+ marching to rights protection for all targeted communities, http://equalitymarch2017.org
SF: 11 am – 5 pm, San Jose: 11 am, [http://equalitymarchsj.domoreproject.org](http://equalitymarchsj.domoreproject.org)

We wrote **50 postcards** to get the vote out for [Archie Parnell](https://archieparnell.com/) in South Carolina's 5th District, special election June 20th.  Go Dems!

**No meeting in June**, as Mark & I will be away.
