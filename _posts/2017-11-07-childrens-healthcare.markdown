Excerpted from 5Calls :

**CHIP Funding Finally Arrives, With Strings**.

The House has finally passed **CHIP reauthorization**, unfortunately they did this by **slashing funding** for the **Prevention and Public Health fund**. Legislation will now move to the **Senate**; *let them know that it is unacceptable to cut important preventative health work to fund equally important healthcare for children*.
