Excerpted from [**Center for American Progress Action Fund**](https://www.americanprogressaction.org/) 

and [**Senator Chris Murphy (CT)**](https://www.murphy.senate.gov/contact) :

"   **Trumpcare is back**, and it’s just as bad—if not **worse**—than before. Republicans are calling it the “[**Cassidy-Graham-Heller bill**](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/17/obamacare-senate-republicans-repeal-242821)” and trying to pass it by **September 30th** with only 51 votes. [**Call and tweet**](https://trumpcaretoolkit.org/) their offices right now to tell them **not to repeal the ACA**!   "

FYI, don't be afraid to call - *even though we aren't their constituents, we have a right to voice our opinion* - and **they should hear us** !

Here's a **sample script**:

*Hi, my name is _______ and I am calling about the Cassidy-Graham-Heller bill.  I'd like to leave a comment.  The Cassidy-Graham-Heller bill will end Medicaid as we know it, will rip coverage from millions of Americans, will gut protections for pre-existing conditions, and will eliminate ACA funding by 2027.  This bill would be a disaster for American health care.  So I'm asking the senator to please vote no on the Cassidy-Graham-Heller bill.  Thank you.*
