"   **Action**: Submit **public testimony** for Monday’s Graham-Cassidy hearing.

**Subject line**: Graham-Cassidy hearing, Monday, Sept. 25, 2017

**Script**: 

I/my family rely/relies on quality, affordable healthcare. Because of this, I oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill. My story with [Medicaid, coverage caps, pre-existing conditions, disabilities, affordability, etc.] is… I would like to see a bipartisan Congressional effort to improve the ACA, not repeal it.
Sincerely, [name]
[address]

**Note**: After September 30, 2017, the Senate will need 60 votes to repeal the ACA, not 51. Their urgency is real. Use your voice today.   "
