Excerpted from [Jenn Hofmann's Checklist](https://jenniferhofmann.com/) :

"   Action: Submit public testimony for Monday’s Graham-Cassidy hearing.

Email: GCHcomments@finance.senate.gov by 1pm EST Monday 9/25.

Subject line: Graham-Cassidy hearing, Monday, Sept. 25, 2017

Script: I/my family rely/relies on quality, affordable healthcare. Because of this, I oppose the Graham-Cassidy bill. My story with [Medicaid, coverage caps, pre-existing conditions, disabilities, affordability, etc.] is… I would like to see a bipartisan Congressional effort to improve the ACA, not repeal it.
Sincerely, [name]
[address]

Note: After September 30, 2017, the Senate will need 60 votes to repeal the ACA, not 51. Their urgency is real. Use your voice today.
