Excerpted from [**5Calls**](https://5calls.org/) :

"STOP THE SNEAKY ROLLBACK OF DODD-FRANK PROTECTIONS - VOTE NEXT WEEK"

"Despite a recent CBO report finding that **S. 2155** would increase the chances of **banks collapsing** due to **decreased oversight**, the bill is moving forward with **bipartisan support** from up to 17 Senate Democrats and Independents. The bill is expected to come to the floor for a vote next week."

Call :
Senator **Feinstein** : **(415) 393-0707**
Senator **Harris** : **(202) 224-3553**

**Sample Script**:

Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a constituent from [CITY].

I'm calling to express my opposition to S. 2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. It's irresponsible to roll back regulations that protect consumers and banks from risky investments that nearly brought down economy a decade ago. I urge the senator to vote against this legislation.

Thank you for your hard work answering the phones.
