"  [**Postcards to Voters**](https://postcardstovoters.org/?link_id=4&can_id=e59665c3f3c1222626c02430d1bf6bdb&source=email-swing-left-san-francisco-newsletter-nov-29-2017&email_referrer=email_269105&email_subject=swing-left-san-francisco-newsletter-nov-29-2017) is a fun way of doing **GOTV** by **hand writing postcards to Democrats**. They're doing a push now for **Doug Jones in Alabama**, with a **deadline of Dec. 5th**. Check them out and write some cards.  We will surely be doing this for CA-10 next year.  "
