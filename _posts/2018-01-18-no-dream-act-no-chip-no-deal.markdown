Excerpted from The [**Daily Kos**](https://www.dailykos.com/) :

"  Republicans need at least nine Democratic votes to pass a [**funding bill**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/12/09/whats-in-the-spending-bill-we-skim-it-so-you-dont-have-to/?utm_term=.9009f9e11e37) through the U.S. Senate.  

So let's make this real simple: **No DREAM Act? No CHIP? No deal**. Your Democratic U.S. senator(s) must hear this.

Call Senator Dianne **Feinstein** at **(415) 393-0707** and Senator Kamala D. **Harris** at **(202) 224-3553**. Demand they **oppose any spending bill that doesn't include the DREAM Act and long-term funding for children's health care.**

**Sample Script**:

Don't leave children and youth in our state behind. NO DREAM ACT? NO CHIP? NO DEAL. Thank you for your time.
