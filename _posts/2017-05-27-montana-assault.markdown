In an election where most of the voting was done early, **Greg Gianforte** has been elected to Congress within a day of **assaulting a reporter** - here's a report from [**the Guardian**](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/26/republicans-condone-violence-greg-gianforte): 

Please take a moment to let **Mr. Gianforte** know what we **expect of elected officials** in the federal government: 

**c/o Greg for Montana 
PO Box 877 
Helena, MT 59624**

Some **points** you might include:

1.  At the end of the day, our **representatives are accountable** to the people, **and the press** is instrumental in holding those members accountable.

2.  In the **House of Representatives Ethics Manual** there is a rule requiring all members to conduct themselves “**at all times in a manner that reflects creditably on the House**.” That rule applies to how members work with the **press**.

3. "If you can't handle tough questions from a reporter, you will have a real tough time handling tough questions from constituents," **Democratic Rep. Seth Moulto**n told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day."

4.  **Virginia Rep. Scott Taylor**, former Navy SEAL, said of his fellow Republican to CNN's John Berman on "New Day",   "No question the behavior is unacceptable."
