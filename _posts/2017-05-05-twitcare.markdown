Words of Wisdom from Indivisible:

Back in November, the word in D.C. was that the Affordable Care Act was a goner. Smart Washington politicos thought Trump might have a repeal bill ready to sign on his first day on the job. The House had voted to repeal it dozens of times. Obama had to veto it once. But Trump is still waiting. Even after today’s vote, Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land. The legislative fight continues, and it only gets harder for Trump now. Because of you.

It’s hard to overstate how cruel this bill is. Simply put, Republicans got TrumpCare passed in the House today by making it more extreme. They had to convince the uber-conservatives in the Freedom Caucus to vote for it, so they had to make it even crueler. The original failed TrumpCare bill last month stripped healthcare from 24 million Americans. But that wasn’t enough for them. The new bill builds on that by:

Gutting protections for pre-existing conditions

Eliminating services for special needs kids in schools

Letting insurers effectively charge women more than men

TrumpCare is a moral monstrosity.

We knew this was coming. Today is a setback, but we always knew the House would be tough for us. We were never supposed to win the House. It’s a majoritarian institution—the party in power sets the rules and decides what gets a vote. Everybody assumed that Trump’s lackeys would jam through TrumpCare in January and that would be that.

But it wasn’t. A bill that should have taken them days instead took FIVE MONTHS. And that’s because resistance groups across the country stood indivisible. We defeated the bill last month together. For months, we blocked the number one legislative priority of a unified conservative government. We proved how powerful constituents are.

And here’s the thing—this was supposed to be the easy part. To become law, this bill has to go through a 5-step process:

Pass in the House

Pass an amended version in the Senate

Go to “conference“ to hammer out differences between the House and Senate

Pass in the House again

Pass in the Senate again
