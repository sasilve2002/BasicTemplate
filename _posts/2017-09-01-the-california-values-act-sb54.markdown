Excerpted from the [Courage Campaign](https://www.couragecampaign.org/)
I'm reaching out to our most courageous members to get your help on the CA Values Act (SB 54) -- a key resistance bill that would help protect California’s communities from Trump’s mass deportation agenda. The California legislative session is nearly over, and we need a HUGE final push to get SB 54 through the Assembly but we can't do it without you.

Next week, we're hosting our Biggest Phone Bank EVER to reach 10,000 calls and build the pressure we need on key Assemblymembers and Gov. Brown to get their support on SB 54. This statewide phone bank will last all week long, Sept. 5th - 8th, and take place during the day from 9am to 6pm. The phone bank is completely virtual so anyone can join from anywhere as long as they have a computer, laptop, or tablet and phone. You can make calls individually or form a small group of phone bankers.
