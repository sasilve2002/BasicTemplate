"  I'm reaching out to our most courageous members to get your help on the **CA Values Act (SB 54)** -- a key resistance bill that would help protect California’s communities from **Trump’s mass deportation agenda**. The California legislative session is nearly over, and we need a HUGE final push to get SB 54 through the Assembly but **we can't do it without you.**
 
**Next week** (Sept. 5th - 8th), we're hosting our **Biggest Phone Bank EVER** to reach **10,000 calls** and build the pressure we need on **key Assemblymembers and Gov. Brown** to get their support on SB 54. This statewide phone bank will last all week long, **Sept. 5th - 8th**, and take place during the day from **9am to 6pm**. The phone bank is completely virtual so anyone can join from anywhere as long as they have a computer, laptop, or tablet and phone. You can make calls individually or form a small group of phone bankers.
