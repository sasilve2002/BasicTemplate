“[IssueVoter](https://issuevoter.org/) is an innovative non-partisan platform that gives everyone a voice in our democracy by making civic engagement accessible, efficient, and impactful.” It connects you directly to your Member of Congress and allows you to pick the issues that are most important to you. IssueVoter sends email alerts with a summary of the bill your Congress Member will vote on, as well as the option to click “Support” or “Oppose” and your view goes directly to your Congressman. IssueVoter also keeps track of how your representative has voted so you can easily see if their values align with yours.

Sign up with IssueVoter and connect with your representative and spread the word (or publicly shame your rep) through social media when an issue that is important to you is up for vote. We are in the resistance for the long haul and we need to utilize all the tools in our resistance tool belt to keep fighting. Become an informed voter AND make your voice heard.
