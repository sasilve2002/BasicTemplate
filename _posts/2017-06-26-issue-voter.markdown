Excerpted from [whatdoidoabouttrump.com](http://whatdoidoabouttrump.com/) :

This is a site : [issuevoter.org](https://issuevoter.org/) -
 which seems to be a cool way to **engage immediately with issues** in which you are especially interested.  **You choose** the issue, a bill about the issue pops up, **you vote**, then **they send** your "comment" to your representatives.

**Give it a try !**
