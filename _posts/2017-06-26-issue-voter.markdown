Excerpted from [whatdoidoabouttrump.com](http://whatdoidoabouttrump.com/) :

This is a site : [issuevoter.org](https://issuevoter.org/) seems to be a cool way to **engage immediately with issues** in which you are especially interested.  You choose the issue, a bill about the issue pops up, you vote, then they send your "comment" to your representatives.

**Give it a try !**
