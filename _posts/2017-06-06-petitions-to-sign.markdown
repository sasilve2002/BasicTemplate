Petitions to Sign
(Excerpted from [What Do I Do About Trump?](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/whatdoidoabouttrump/15c7e7ba9196285e)
According to a draft of Trump’s new birth control coverage exemption, any employer, school or insurance company would be allowed to opt out of covering contraception based not only on religious objection but on any moral objection as well.  Even massive for-profit companies with no religious affiliation would be able to deny birth control coverage to their female employees.  Let’s sign this petition to support birth control access for all women:  http://petitions.moveon.org/keystoneprogress/sign/i-support-birth-control.
Let’s join Center for American Progress, Sierra Club, National Resources Defense Council, League of Conservation Voters, Environment America, Oxfam, Climate Nexus, Environmental Defense Fund, Climate Reality Project, Organizing For Action, Union of Concerned Scientists, Interfaith Power and Light, World Wildlife Fund, Resistance Manual, Chicago Women Take Action, National Health Law Program, Moms Clean Air Task Force, Defend our Future, and tell the 194 countries still in the Paris Agreement that we, the people, are still in.  https://iamstillin.org/
