Please **RSVP** : **sasilve2002@gmail.com**

We will be welcoming Andrea from [**Sister District Project CA-13**](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/ca13/) to our meeting, to help us get started **duplicating** this week's **[flipping successes](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/us/politics/virginia-election-democrats.html)** for **2018**.  

We are also welcoming members from [**Redwood Heights Indivisible Collective**](https://www.facebook.com/rhindivisiblec/).  Awesome!

*Bring a friend/relative/neighbor* - anyone who is upset at **TwitterTwit's deplorable shenanigans** - it'll make them feel better, and make a bigger impact **against** this administration's attacks on **IMMIGRANTS** & **HEALTHCARE** & help us **FLIP DISTRICTS**.
