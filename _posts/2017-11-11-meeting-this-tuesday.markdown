Next Nothing Rhymes with Orange meeting:

This coming Tuesday
Nov. 14, 2017
7:30 pm
Please RSVP : sasilve2002@gmail.com

We will be welcoming Andrea from [**Sister District Project CA-13**](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/ca13/) to our meeting, to help us get started duplicating this week's flipping successes in 2018.

We are also welcoming members from [Redwood Heights Indivisible Collective](https://www.facebook.com/rhindivisiblec/).  Awesome!

Bring a friend/relative/neighbor - anyone who is upset at TwitterTwit's deplorable shenanigans - it'll make them feel better, and make a bigger impact against this administration's attacks on IMMIGRANTS & HEALTHCARE & help us FLIP DISTRICTS.
