Excerpted from [**Daily Kos**](https://www.dailykos.com/) :   

"  Senate Republicans and Donald Trump have decided not to include protections for immigrant youth who came to the United States as children in a year-end spending deal even though Paul Ryan had stated they would earlier in the week.  "

"  This version of the bill improves upon previous bills. It expands eligibility and raises the age of entry requirement to 18 years of age—allowing more undocumented youth to qualify. It also works with current Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) — the deferred action program that protects undocumented youth from deportation — recipients to reduce some barriers as they work towards citizenship. Without legislation like the Dream Act, there is no pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth living in the U.S.  "
