"  **Senate Republicans** and Donald **Trump** have decided not to include **protections for immigrant youth** who came to the United States as children in a year-end spending deal even though Paul Ryan had stated they would earlier in the week.  "

"  This version of the bill ([**Dream Act of 2017**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615)) improves upon previous bills. It **expands eligibility** and raises the age of entry requirement to 18 years of age—allowing more undocumented youth to qualify. It also **works with** current Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (**DACA**) — the deferred action program that protects undocumented youth from deportation — recipients to **reduce some barriers** as they work towards **citizenship**. Without legislation like the Dream Act, **there is no pathway to citizenship for undocumented youth living in the U.S**.  "
