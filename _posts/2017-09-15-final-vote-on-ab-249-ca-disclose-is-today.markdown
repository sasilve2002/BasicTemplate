Excerpted from [California Clean Money Campaign](http://www.caclean.org/) :
Today's the day!  The Assembly votes on AB 249, the California DISCLOSE Act, our game-changing bill to fight secret money in politics by making political ads show the real names of their top 3 funders!

This is the final vote needed to send to the Governor's desk the landmark bill that will strike the biggest blow yet to the unlimited money unleashed by Citizen United.  Because the bill needs a 2/3 majority there's not a vote to spare.

That's why we're asking Clean Money supporters like you to call your Assemblymember today (Friday) â€” phone calls from constituents like these helped AB 249 pass the Senate on Monday by an overwhelming bipartisan 29-to-9!

NOW, PLEASE CALL and ask YOUR Assemblymember to vote "Yes" on AB 249!  It's easy because our calling tool looks up your Senator, their number, and tells you what to say.
