New Citizens Swearing In Ceremonies
Please plan to arrive on time for either event so we can do a training and distribute the volunteers between the two stations. If you plan to drive, allow 30-45 minutes to look for parking which fills up very early. This is an outdoor standing event so please be prepared to stand for up to 2 hours and dress according to the weather (casual is fine).
The Paramount Theatre is 1/2 block from the 19th St. BART station. Please RSVP below:

February, 15 am, 10 am: RSVP

February 15, 2 pm: RSVP

Thank You to those of you who join us regularly. This is one of the really joyous events we do.

PHONE BANKS AROUND THE BAY:
The Democracy Action network now has Phone Bank listings for San Francisco, East Bay, and Marin, with more coming online soon. We are still making calls to voters in other states to ask them to call their Members of Congress about a clean Dream Act vote.The next Budget Showdown is on Feb. 8th when this will be a big factor re: Gov. Shutdown again. We will also have call lists for Conor Lamb in the special election in PA-18, and more popping up as they occur. We continue our work recruiting volunteers for CD-10.
