***Let's get EVERYONE registered to vote !***


Excerpted from [**Democracy Action**](https://demaction.us/) :

"  [**Naturalization Ceremony in Oakland**](https://oaklandnorth.net/2017/10/02/thousands-become-us-citizens-in-oakland-and-react-strongly-to-trumps-welcome-message/):   "

Helping brand new Americans activate their citizenship by registering to vote is one of the most fulfilling activities we can participate in. From countries all over the world, they pour out of the Paramount Theater after taking the oath of allegiance to their new homeland, where we welcome them with an offer to register to vote the same day.

Join us at 10 am or at 2 pm in front of the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. Look for a row of ironing boards on both sides of the entrance. No experience is necessary - we will train on site at 10 am and 2 pm.

Please plan to **arrive on time** for either event so we can do a **training** and distribute the volunteers between the two stations. If you plan to drive, **allow 30-45 minutes to look for parking** which fills up very early. This is an **outdoor standing event** so please be prepared to stand for up to **2 hours** and dress according to the weather (casual is fine).
[**The Paramount Theatre**](http://www.paramounttheatre.com/) is 1/2 block from the **19th St. BART** station. Please **RSVP** below:  "

Thank You to those of you who join us regularly. This is one of the really joyous events we do.
