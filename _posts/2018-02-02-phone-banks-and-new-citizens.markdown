***Let's get EVERYONE registered to vote !***

Excerpted from [**Democracy Action**](https://demaction.us/) :

"  [**Naturalization Ceremony in Oakland**](https://oaklandnorth.net/2017/10/02/thousands-become-us-citizens-in-oakland-and-react-strongly-to-trumps-welcome-message/):   "

Helping brand new Americans activate their citizenship by registering to vote is one of the most fulfilling activities we can participate in. 

Join us at 10 am or at 2 pm in front of the Paramount Theatre in Oakland. Look for a row of ironing boards on both sides of the entrance. No experience is necessary - we will train on site at 10 am and 2 pm.
