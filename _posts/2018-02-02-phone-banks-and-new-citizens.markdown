Please plan to **arrive on time** for either event so we can do a **training** and distribute the volunteers between the two stations. If you plan to drive, **allow 30-45 minutes to look for parking** which fills up very early. This is an **outdoor standing event** so please be prepared to stand for up to **2 hours** and dress according to the weather (casual is fine).
[**The Paramount Theatre**](http://www.paramounttheatre.com/) is 1/2 block from the **19th St. BART** station. Please **RSVP** below:

**PHONE BANKS AROUND THE BAY**:
The [**Democracy Action**](https://demaction.us/) network now has **Phone Bank** listings for **San Francisco, East Bay, and Marin**, with more coming online soon. We are still making calls to **voters in other states** to ask them to call their Members of Congress about a **clean Dream Act vote**.The next Budget Showdown is on Feb. 8th when this will be a big factor re: **Gov. Shutdown** again. We will also have call lists for [**Conor Lamb**](https://conorlamb.com/) in the **special election** in **PA-18**, and more popping up as they occur. We continue our work **recruiting volunteers for CD-10**.
