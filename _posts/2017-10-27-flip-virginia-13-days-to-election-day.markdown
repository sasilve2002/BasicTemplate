"  Hey CA-13! It's 13 days to Election Day in Virginia!
It's the GOTV [*"Get Out The Vote"*] push so let's get every Democrat out to vote.
 
RSVP to GOTV here: [http://bit.ly/2vB2iNr](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_VTJYro3E3FgFrNNoKnc6AypEqo14Hjw14krn-L7aJwW6vA/viewform?link_id=4&can_id=a0808b54f5b462f790d1476ee8a2c1f3&source=email-upcoming-phone-banks-to-flip-virginia-state-house&email_referrer=upcoming-phone-banks-to-flip-virginia-state-house&email_subject=upcoming-phone-banks-to-flip-virginia-state-house)

We have SIX call parties planned between now and election day. New additions to the schedule include WEEKDAY GOTV phone bank parties on NOVEMBER 6 and 7 -- the Monday before and Tuesday of the election! We are leaving messages for Tran and Turpin, so the parties will be very active.

Text- Banking
You can text to #TurnVABlue in your spare time or with a party of friends!  Join us in texting for candidates up and down the ballot in Virginia by volunteering through https://www.sisterdistrict.com/programs/textbanking/  and using the password: "gameonva"  We'll be using a new application called GroundGame to reach out to voters - you won't be using your own phone or phone number to text with, and the campaign provides sample scripts for you to use in your conversations.  So easy!  We've had great results already in September and October, texting with voters about where their candidates stand on the issues, how to get absentee ballots or volunteer for the campaign, and now we are in the last push to make sure they have their plans to vote. If you are a District Captain, you cn contact Maya in the Textbanking channel on Slack and if you are not, then get in touch with Penni if you need help at pennitakade@gmail.com

Postcards
While the Cheryl Turpin (VA-85) campaign has ended, Kathy Tran (VA-42) has not.  You can still get bulk addresses and instructions for parties this weekend from Ben on postcards@sisterdistrict.com.  If you just have time to write 5 yourself, Jeff and Andrea are still running their virtual postcard party for Kathy Tran, just email them at sdp.ca.13.postcards@gmail.com.  This postcard campaign will end on October 31st and you mail them yourself so get them in the mail by Halloween!

And I am out of postcards but Mary (mary.sisterdistrict.ca13@gmail.com) still has them on her porch.  I'll be ordering more and we have a new designer so we will have two Vote! postcards.
Election Night Party - November 7th 6:30 to 9:30 at Townie

We have an election night party at  Townie (1799 University Avenue, Berkeley) from 6:30 to 9:30.  Melanie will be reporting in from Virginia, we will be contributing to the SDP party on Facebook and we will be writing thankyou cards to all of our canvassers in Virginia and the generous SDP, TWW, Indivisible and campaign volunteers who opened up their homes and hosted our canvassers.  Come see all our hard work have results and thank everyone for what they have done!  RSVP on Facebook to the link below.  See you there!
