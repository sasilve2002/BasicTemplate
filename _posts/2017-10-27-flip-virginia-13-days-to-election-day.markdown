You can text to [**#TurnVABlue**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/turnvablue?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag) in your spare time or with a party of friends!  [**Click here to join us**](https://www.sisterdistrict.com/programs/textbanking/) in texting for candidates up and down the ballot in Virginia by volunteering and using the password: "gameonva"  We'll be using a new application called GroundGame to reach out to voters - you won't be using your own phone or phone number to text with, and the campaign provides sample scripts for you to use in your conversations.  So easy!  We've had great results already in September and October, texting with voters about where their candidates stand on the issues, how to get absentee ballots or volunteer for the campaign, and now we are in the last push to make sure they have their plans to vote. If you are a District Captain, you cn contact Maya in the Textbanking channel on Slack and if you are not, then get in touch with Penni if you need help at pennitakade@gmail.com   "
