**Time to GOTV (get out the vote) for 2018 !**

We've been trying to connect with :
**(1) homeless community activists** to help them register the unhoused to vote,
and 
**(2) Skyline High School**,  to help them register 16- & 17-year olds to vote. 
Hopefully, we will have someone from one of these groups at our next meeting.

In addition, we will be writing postcards, care of [**TonyTheDemocrat**](https://onethingyoucando.com/tag/tony-the-democrat/), to remind **democrats to vote** in a **special election on March 13** in **Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District** ([Conor Lamb](https://conorlamb.com/voter-faq/)).  I have 30 addresses 

If you can **bring a laptop**, we can discover how to **text folks , from the comfort of your favorite arm chair**, to remind them to vote.

**Next Meeting**:

**Tuesday**,

**Feb. 6, 2018**

**7:30-9:00 pm**

**BRING A FRIEND**
