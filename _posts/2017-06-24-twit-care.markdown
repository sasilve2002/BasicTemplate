-- **FYI** -- You can do this action even if you and your family are not personally affected by TrumpCare --

" Health Care: **Shut down Senate business** until the GOP agrees to **open hearings** on the healthcare bill.

By introducing tens of thousands of amendments, Democrats can slow down the process [of reconciliation]” that Republicans are using to try to ram through Trumpcare with 50 votes instead of the usual 60."
