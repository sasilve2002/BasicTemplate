*It's one of those things that sounds good - we all want better **wireless coverage** - but the **Sierra Club** and **League of Conservation Voters** are against it.*

Excerpted from From the [**California Alliance for Safer Technology**](http://www.ca4safertech.com/will-assembly-member-gonzalez-fletcher-oppose-sb-649-risk-pristine-environmental-voting-record-downgraded-sierra-club-league-conservation-voters/)  :


"  [SB 649](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB649) is a controversial bill being heard in the [Assembly Appropriations Committee](http://apro.assembly.ca.gov/) on August 23rd. While the telecom industry claims this is an infrastructure bill that will provide wireless users greater coverageâ€¦.. 270 cities and 45 counties remain strongly opposed to the bill.  "

Dear Representative Bonta,

I am very concerned about the impact of Senate Bill 649 on our state. This bill would take away local control and regulation of cell phone tower instillation by our cities, and give it to the telecom industry. The industry would not be required to pay compensation for the land on which cell phone towers are built. It would also not help to end the digital divide, as proponents are claiming. There is nothing in this legislation to require the telecom people to increase coverage in poor areas, and we have every reason to believe, from past experience, that the industry would increase coverage in only wealthier areas.

The proliferation of cell phone towers is also harmful to humans, animals and the environment. It will dramatically increase the amount of radiation being released into the air.

On a personal note, I have EMF sensitivities. The result is that I get sick when around electronic and electrical devices. I did not have it until after I moved into my current location, with telephone wires close to my apartment and 4 smart meters outside my bedroom window. I can only be on computers and cell phones for very short amounts of time, and haven't been able to use any electric devises since December. I had to go without any heat all winter, and can no longer use my stove, TV, radio, ect. I get migraine headaches and severe nausea if I do so. Like so many others with my condition, we would be devastated by this legislation. Increased cell phone towers could put many others at risk of developing this sensitivity.

Please oppose Senate Bill #649. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Alegra Dashielle
