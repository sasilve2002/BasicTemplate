Excerpted from [**The California Clean Money Campaign**](http://www.caclean.org/) :

"   **WE DID IT**! After 7 years work by thousands of Clean Money volunteers, the **Assembly passed AB 249**, the California Disclose Act, on a **huge bipartisan** vote of 59-15. Now it's on to **Governor Brown's desk**!
