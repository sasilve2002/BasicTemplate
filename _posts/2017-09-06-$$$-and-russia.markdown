PROTECT FUNDING FOR THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION!

Excerpted from [**3NoTrump** ](http://www.3notrump.org/):

"  As the **September 30th** deadline looms for Congress to pass a **[2018 federal budget](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-gop-unveils-budget-plan-that-attaches-major-spending-cuts-to-coming-tax-reform-bill/2017/07/18/6e68b679-c63a-4dd1-a3da-e191636946ad_story.html?utm_term=.dbb462ce2c84)** and spending package, some lawmakers are taking advantage of these urgent, must-pass bills by adding **controversial, hyper-partisan amendments** to them. One such amendment comes from **Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-FL)**. His proposal would **defund [Mueller's independent Russia investigation](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/11/542629755/mueller-turns-up-the-heat-with-unusual-search-warrant-in-russia-probe)** 6 months after passage of the bill and prohibit the investigators from looking into any matters that occurred prior to June 2015, the start of Trump's presidential campaign. House Democrats, on the other hand, have prepared various amendments to protect and maintain Department of Justice funding for Mueller's probe.  .... it is **important for Congress to know** that the American people support Mueller and want the **Russia investigation to continue** until its natural completion. Any Congressional effort to end or hinder this investigation would take away the public's right to **know the truth**.  "
