Excerpted from [Indivisible](https://www.indivisible.org/) :

"   Let’s be clear: the Trump Tax Scam is a massive giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, paid for by raising taxes on some middle class families and slashing critical social programs like Medicare and Medicaid. They want to eliminate taxes that only affect the wealthiest individuals and let corporations pay even less than they already do. Almost all of the tax benefits from the Republicans’ plan will go to the top 1%, which will exacerbate our country’s massive racial wealth gap.   "
