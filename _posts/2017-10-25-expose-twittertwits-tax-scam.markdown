Excerpted from [**Indivisible**](https://www.indivisible.org/) :

"   Let’s be clear: the Trump Tax Scam is a massive giveaway to the wealthy and corporations, paid for by raising taxes on some middle class families and slashing critical social programs like Medicare and Medicaid. [They want to eliminate taxes](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/tax-cuts-donald-trump-wants-give-millionaire-friends/) that only affect the wealthiest individuals and [let corporations pay even less](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/corporations-already-gaming-tax-system-trump-wants-let-pay-even-less/) than they already do. Almost all of the tax benefits from the Republicans’ plan will go to the top 1%, which will exacerbate our country’s [massive racial wealth gap](https://prosperitynow.org/files/PDFs/road_to_zero_wealth.pdf).
