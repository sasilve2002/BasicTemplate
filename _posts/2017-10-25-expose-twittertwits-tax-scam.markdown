"   Let’s be clear: the **Trump Tax Scam is a massive giveaway** to the wealthy and corporations, paid for by **raising taxes on some middle class** families and **slashing critical social programs** like Medicare and Medicaid. 

[They want to **eliminate taxes**](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/tax-cuts-donald-trump-wants-give-millionaire-friends/) that only affect the wealthiest individuals and [**let corporations pay even less**](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/corporations-already-gaming-tax-system-trump-wants-let-pay-even-less/) than they already do. Almost all of the tax benefits from the Republicans’ plan will **go to the top 1%**, which will exacerbate our country’s [**massive racial wealth gap**](https://prosperitynow.org/files/PDFs/road_to_zero_wealth.pdf).
