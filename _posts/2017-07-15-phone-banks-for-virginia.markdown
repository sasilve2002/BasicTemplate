[Click here for the link to Sister District Project's information and directions on **phone-banking** for **Cheryl Turpin**](http://mailchi.mp/sisterdistrict/phonebanking-for-cheryl?e=16b55cad2c).  Sister District Project is organizing phone-banks weekly, so you can join future banks and/or do this from your own phone.

**2 options**:  **1)** you can **join a phone-bank** group; or **2)** you can **phone directly from your own phone** at home (or anywhere) on your own.

Please let me know how it goes.

**GO TEAM !!  Let's flip Virginia !**
