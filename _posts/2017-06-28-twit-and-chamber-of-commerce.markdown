Excerpted from [Corporate Accountability International](http://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/) :

"  **Resist** the **Trump** administration’s pro-privatization infrastructure agenda.

**CHALLENGE THE US CHAMBER OF COMMERCE**	

The **U.S. Chamber of Commerce** is a national, **hyper-partisan** corporate front group behind much of the **Trump agenda**. It throws gobs of **corporate cash** at issues like **opposing** action on **climate change** and defeating public **health protections**. 

Yet corporations that claim to favor climate action and public health protections continue to pay dues to the Chamber. It’s time for **corporations** like Gap, Disney, and Pepsi to **#DropTheChamber**. "
