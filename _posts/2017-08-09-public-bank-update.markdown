From [**Friends of the Public Bank of Oakland**](https://friendsofpublicbankofoakland.org/next-meeting-and-other-events/):
Next Deadline:
We come before the City Council on Tuesday, September 19, to make our case once again. Details about how to participate in that meeting will be available closer to the time. Meanwhile, we welcome your donation to help make up the $25,000 Oakland wants from other sources. If you are able to donate, please select “Other” at the link and put “Friends of the Public Bank of Oakland” in the “in honor of” box, so our fiscal sponsor can keep its books straight. And thank you!
