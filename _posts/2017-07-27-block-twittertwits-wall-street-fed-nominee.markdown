"  **Trump** nominated yet another **Wall Street insider** to run our economy in service of the **banks**, and we need to **fight back!**

**Today** is the Senate nomination **hearing** for “Wall Street Lawyer” Randal **Quarles** as the Federal Reserve vice chairman for supervision – what many consider to be the **top banking watchdog role** in the country. 

We can’t let the Senate sneak through another corporate nominee **who won't stand up to banks and billionaires**.
