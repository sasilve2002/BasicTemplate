Excerpted from [**5Calls**](https://5calls.org/):

"   **House Republicans** are trying hard to pass **HR 3697**, which would amend the **Immigration and Nationality Act** to give the [**DHS** [Department of Homeland Security]](https://www.dhs.gov/) new sweeping authority to designate **who is in a gang**, and to **deport them without question**. This new power would create a legal authority to launch a wave of deportations **that cannot be challenged**.   "
