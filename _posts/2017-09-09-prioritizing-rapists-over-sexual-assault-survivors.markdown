Excerpted from [**NARAL** Pro-Choice America](https://www.prochoiceamerica.org/)

"   According to Secretary of Education Betsy **DeVos**'s announcement on **Title IX protections** for sexual assault survivors, DeVos wants to **rescind protections** that can help survivors feel safe on campus, and make it harder for schools to punish rapists....**Perpetrators** of sexual violence often walk away with **zero consequences**, while their victims are left to piece together their lives after the trauma.   "
