According to Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos's announcement on Title IX protections for sexual assault survivors, DeVos wants to rescind protections that can help survivors feel safe on campus, and make it harder for schools to punish rapists. Perpetrators of sexual violence often walk away with zero consequences, while their victims are left to piece together their lives after the trauma.
