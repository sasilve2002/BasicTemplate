"   According to Secretary of Education Betsy **DeVos**'s announcement on **[Title IX](http://www.titleix.info/) protections** for sexual assault survivors, DeVos wants to **rescind protections** that can help survivors feel safe on campus, and make it harder for schools to punish rapists....**Perpetrators** of sexual violence often walk away with **zero consequences**, while their victims are left to piece together their lives after the trauma.   "
