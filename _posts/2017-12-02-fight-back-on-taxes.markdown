Excerpted from [Indivisible](https://www.indivisible.org/) :

"  Turn your **anger** at the Senate's vote **for the Tax Scam** vote into **action** on the next big fight for a DREAM Act.  **Call** your **Senators** 

[[Harris (202) 224-3553](https://www.harris.senate.gov/) &

[[Feinstein](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/)) (202) 224-3841 

to tell them to take the **[Dreamer Pledge](https://www.dreamerpledge.org/)**: a commitment to stand up for Dreamers and only pass a **continuing resolution (CR)** that **includes** the **DREAM Act**.
