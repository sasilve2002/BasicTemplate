Excerpted from the [**Tax March**](https://taxmarch.org/):

"  We’re getting reports that the **FINAL votes** on the **tax scam bill** in the **House** and **Senate** will happen **early next week**, with Democratic Senator-elect **Doug Jones’ victory** in Alabama this week only making **Republicans** even more anxious to **rush it to a vote**.

"  Our best chance to **kill this bill** is to make sure that a couple of key **Republican senators** change their minds and vote the **right way**. That means they need to hear from their constituents -- and **you can help** make that happen.

"  The **83 million middle-class families** who will see their **taxes go up**, the **13 million people** who will be kicked off their **health care**, and many more Americans just trying to get by.

"  Get in touch with a **constituent in a key state** and encourage them to **contact their Republican senators** right now.  "
