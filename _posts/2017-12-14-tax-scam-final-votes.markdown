We’re getting reports that the FINAL votes on the tax scam bill in the House and Senate will happen early next week, with Democratic Senator-elect Doug Jones’ victory in Alabama this week only making Republicans even more anxious to rush it to a vote.

Our best chance to kill this bill is to make sure that a couple of key Republican senators change their minds and vote the right way. That means they need to hear from their constituents -- and you can help make that happen.
