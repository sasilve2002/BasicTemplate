Excerpted from [ACLU People Power](https://www.aclu.org/blog-feed/people-power) :

"  .....it's crucial that we take this momentum and redouble our efforts to expand voting rights and make our democracy more representative.  "

"  The call to action is to convince California’s election officials to make same day registration a reality for all of California’s eligible voters in the 2018 elections by making it available in communities that need it the most. California has a new same day registration (SDR) law that allows voters who miss the 15-day voter registration deadline to register and vote in the two weeks before and on Election Day. But there is a HUGE catch: the law only requires counties to offer SDR at the county elections office. This means, unless eligible voters have the time and means to get to the elections office, in most counties SDR isn’t a real option for them, especially those who face long-standing barriers to registration and voting.
