Excerpted from [**ACLU People Power**](https://www.aclu.org/blog-feed/people-power) :

"  .....it's crucial that we take this momentum and redouble our efforts to **expand voting rights** and make our democracy more representative.  "

"  The call to action is to convince California’s election officials to **make same day registration a reality** for all of California’s eligible voters in the 2018 elections by making it **available in communities** that need it the most. California has a [new **same day registration** (**SDR**) law](http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx) that allows voters who miss the 15-day voter registration deadline to **register and vote in the two weeks before and on Election Day**. But there is a **HUGE catch**: the law only requires counties to offer SDR at the **county elections office**. This means, unless eligible voters have the time and means to get to the elections office, in most counties SDR isn’t a real option for them, especially those who **face long-standing barriers** to registration and voting.
