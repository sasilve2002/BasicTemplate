"  [**SunCal**](http://suncal.com/)'s [**Oak Knoll Project**](http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2017/02/17/oakland-council-oks-oak-knoll-parcels-sale-talks-amid-affordability-outcry/): 

Is being built **without union labor** and will not provide family-sustaining **wages for construction workers**.

Doesn’t provide **apprenticeships** for young construction workers.

Provides for **no on-sight affordable housing**.

Adds **11,000 new car trips** daily, increasing traffic congestion.

Will **clear cut a forest** of native oak trees.

Allows **uncontrolled construction emissions** to pollute neighborhood air quality.

**SunCal**, a large **out-of-town developer**, is proposing an exclusive community of **luxury homes** on 188 acres of the **Oak Knoll Naval Hospital site** in the Oakland Hills. This is the second largest development ever proposed in Oakland and it needs to provide a benefit to the community we’ve created. 

[**Sign our petition**](http://www.ebrrd.org/sign_our_petition_stop_suncal) and tell the Oakland **City Council** that this project **should not go forward** unless it addresses these issues.  "
