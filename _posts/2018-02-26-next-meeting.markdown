Our **next meeting** will be with the [**Redwood Heights Indivisible Collective**](https://www.facebook.com/pg/rhindivisiblec/about/?ref=page_internal).  

This is a great group that is large enough to split into smaller working groups.  

Please come so that our group is represented - ***I believe we can work together to make a bigger impact***.

**this Saturday**

**March 3, 2018**

**10 am - 12 pm**

**Oakland 94619**
  

I have sent you an email with the address.
