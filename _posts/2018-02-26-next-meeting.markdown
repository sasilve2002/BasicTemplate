Our **next meeting** will be with the [**Redwood Heights Indivisible Collective**](https://www.facebook.com/pg/rhindivisiblec/about/?ref=page_internal).  

This is a great group that is large enough to split into smaller working groups.  

Please come so that our group is represented - ***I believe we can work together to make a bigger impact***.  

Please call me if you have any questions ï¤—
