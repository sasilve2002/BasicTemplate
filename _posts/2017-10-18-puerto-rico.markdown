Excerpted from [**My Civic Workout**](https://www.mycivicworkout.com/) :

"   Weeks after **multiple hurricanes** devastated parts of the Caribbean and the North American mainland, both **Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands** remain in desperate need of **aid**. 84% of Puerto Ricans still lack electricity and around 37% do not have access to potable water.   "

"   Congress has approved [[**H.Res. 569**](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hres569)] some supplementary funding for FEMA’s efforts in **Puerto Rico**.   "

[Representative **Barbara Lee** **voted** (click here to see the vote) ](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h566)**for this additional funding**.

**Our Action**:
 
**Call or fax Rep. Lee and thank her** for her efforts and encourage her to support further measures to fund the recovery. 

[**Congresswoman Lee**](https://lee.house.gov/contact)
