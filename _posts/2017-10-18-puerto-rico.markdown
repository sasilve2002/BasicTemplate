Excerpted from [**My Civic Workout**](https://www.mycivicworkout.com/) :

"   Weeks after multiple hurricanes devastated parts of the Caribbean and the North American mainland, both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands remain in desperate need of aid. 84% of Puerto Ricans still lack electricity and around 37% do not have access to potable water.   "

"   Congress has approved [[H.Res. 569](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hres569)] some supplementary funding for FEMAâ€™s efforts in Puerto Rico.   "

[Representative Barbara Lee voted (click here to see the vote) ](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/h566)for this additional funding. 
Call or fax Rep. Lee and thank her for her efforts and encourage her to support further measures to fund the recovery.
