Immigration is a complex issue in this country and one that many lawmakers are consistently arguing over. **Lin-Manuel Miranda**, creator of the Broadway musical **Hamilton**, recently announced the [#Ham4All](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ham4all?source=feed_text&story_id=583773388678340) **challenge** in support of **Immigrants**: **[We Get the Job Done Coalition](http://www.npr.org/event/music/534746532/watch-lin-manuel-mirandas-stunning-new-video-for-immigrants-we-get-the-job-done)**, an alliance of 12 immigration-focused nonprofits throughout the US.
