Immigration is a complex issue in this country and one that many lawmakers are consistently arguing over. **Lin-Manuel Miranda**, creator of the Broadway musical **Hamilton**, recently announced the [#Ham4All](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ham4all?source=feed_text&story_id=583773388678340) **challenge** in support of **Immigrants**: **We Get the Job Done Coalition**, an alliance of 12 immigration-focused nonprofits throughout the US.

Watch his stunning new video here and then send Lin-Manuel a thank you postcard. And, if you can, consider donating to the cause here: [https://hispanicfederation.org/donate/](https://hispanicfederation.org/donate/)
