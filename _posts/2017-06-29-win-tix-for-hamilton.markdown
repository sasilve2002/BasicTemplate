Your chance to win tickets to "Hamilton" --


"  Daily Thank You 6.29.17

Immigration is a complex issue in this country and one that many lawmakers are consistently arguing over. Lin-Manuel Miranda, creator of the Broadway musical Hamilton, recently announced the [#Ham4All](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/ham4all?source=feed_text&story_id=583773388678340) challenge in support of Immigrants: We Get the Job Done Coalition, an alliance of 12 immigration-focused nonprofits throughout the US.

Watch his stunning new video here and then send Lin-Manuel a thank you postcard. And, if you can, consider donating to the cause here: https://hispanicfederation.org/donate/
