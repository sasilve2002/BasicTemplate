"This week’s elections: **Democrat Jimmy Gomez** was elected as the newest representative in **California’s 34th** House district this Tuesday. 

**New Jersey Democrats** also held their statewide primaries, nominating **Phil Murphy** to replace Chris Christie as **governor in November** and reclaim the state as a Democratic trifecta."
