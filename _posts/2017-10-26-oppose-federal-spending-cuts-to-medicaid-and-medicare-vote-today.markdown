Excerpted from [**5Calls**](https://5calls.org/) :

"  The **House** is expected to **vote** on the final passage of the **Senate budget resolution** on [**today**] Thursday, October 26th. The bill narrowly passed the Senate on October 19th, with a 49-51 vote.  "

"  The Senate Republicans' budget resolution for FY 2018 proposes **deep cuts** to the federal budget totaling roughly $5 trillion over 10 years. These cuts target **Medicare**,** Medicaid** and a myriad of other programs that constitute the “**social safety net**,” and will be used to offset **tax cuts** predominantly for **wealthy** Americans.
