Excerpted from [Rogan's List](http://roganslist.blogspot.com/) :

" **Spicer** conducted an **off-camera briefing** with reporters on Monday in which the **press was told it could not film or broadcast audio of the proceedings**. Spicer conducted the [last on-camera ](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/338457-white-house-reporters-fume-over-off-camera-briefings)briefing last Monday. 

**What are they hiding?** 

Let’s support the **Free Press** and make a **complaint** to the **White House**. 

Here's an **idea for a script**:

Quoted from **Hugo L. Black**, Former Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, (New York Times Company v. United States, 1971):

"In the First Amendment, the Founding Fathers gave the free press the protection it must have to fulfill its essential role in our democracy. The press was to serve the governed, not the governors. The Government's power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the Government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of government and inform the people."
