Excerpted from [**Indivisible**](https://www.indivisible.org/) :

"  Tell your **Democratic MoC**: No Trump Tax Scam! 

"  The first step is to pass a bill through the House, which is why it’s critical that we tell Democrats they need to stand strong against the Trump Tax Scam. The more we can delay this bill and give people time to learn about what’s really in it, the better a chance we have of stopping the Trump Tax Scam before it ever gets off the ground. Call your Democratic MoC and tell them: do everything you can to prevent tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. NO to the Trump Tax Scam.  "
