This is a great opportunity to tie in a fun trip to SF with a chance to show our pro-democracy spirit.

Excerpted from [**RefuseFascism.org**](https://refusefascism.org/):

"We’ve been following **Indivisible**, and we are hearing from members that we share the same concerns about Trump, Pence and the Members of Congress who do his bidding.  We agree with your members that **it's getting late, and that we need to act way before 2018**. "

"There is a way forward: **a massive movement** of people taking to the streets in non violent protest every day and night until this **regime is removed from power**. **This begins November 4**."

"**Fascism is a qualitative change in how society is governed**. Fascism foments and relies on **xenophobic nationalism, racism, misogyny, and the aggressive re-institution of oppressive “traditional values.”**  In his election campaign, Trump encouraged and fed on the threat and use of violence to build a movement and come to power. In his inaugural address he pledged allegiance only to this movement - a movement that led to deaths of the heroes of Portland, Heather Heyer’s murder, and a state of emergency in Gainesville, FL, where who knows what may be unleashed."

"It is crucial to understand that once in power **fascism essentially eliminates traditional democratic rights**. A recent poll found that 52% of people who identify as or lean Republican said they would support postponing the 2020 election to ensure that only eligible citizens could vote if it was proposed by President Trump. Think about that."

"**We do not have much time**."
