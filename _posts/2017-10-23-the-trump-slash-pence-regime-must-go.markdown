We’ve been following Indivisible, and we are hearing from members that we share the same concerns about Trump, Pence and the Members of Congress who do his bidding.  We agree with your members that it's getting late, and that we need to act way before 2018. 
There is a way forward: a massive movement of people taking to the streets in non violent protest every day and night until this regime is removed from power. This begins November 4.
Fascism is a qualitative change in how society is governed. Fascism foments and relies on xenophobic nationalism, racism, misogyny, and the aggressive re-institution of oppressive “traditional values.”  In his election campaign, Trump encouraged and fed on the threat and use of violence to build a movement and come to power. In his inaugural address he pledged allegiance only to this movement - a movement that led to deaths of the heroes of Portland, Heather Heyer’s murder, and a state of emergency in Gainesville, FL, where who knows what may be unleashed.
