According to Northern California Resistance (I cannot verify this because I have no cell connection where I am right now)  **tomorrow**, **Barbara Lee** will be in **Oakland** for a **press conference** to launch **Resistance Summer** – a national effort to train, organize, and mobilize Democrats in every community across the country. 

This will be a great opportunity to meet grassroots organizers and organizations, sign up for organizing events, and share ideas for how we can continue moving forward together in the resistance.
