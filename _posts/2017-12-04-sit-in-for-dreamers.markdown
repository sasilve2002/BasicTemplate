Excerpted from [**Our Revolution**](https://ourrevolution.com/ourdream/) 

On the heels of last week's Tax Scam:

"  Right **now**, we have a unique opportunity to pass a clean [**DREAM Act**](https://www.indivisible.org/resource/tell-senator-defend-daca-support-durbin-graham-dream-act/) that would provide **permanent protection for undocumented youth**.  "

"  Undocumented youth are leading a campaign to **take over MoC’s** offices across the country to demand they stand for Dreamers." 
 
"  **We can win this** – IF hundreds of us **sit-in** and take over the offices of Representatives and Senators across the country to demand they make a choice: stand with Dreamers or stand by as 800,000 young immigrants are deported.  "
