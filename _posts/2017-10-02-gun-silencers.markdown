Excerpted from [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/) :

More than 50 people were killed (and more than 500 injured) at a mass shooting in Las Vegas last night, and what was Congress about to do? Pass an NRA-sponsored bill to deregulate gun silencers. 

The ridiculously named "Hearing Protection Act" would eliminate restrictions on silencers and instead treat them as ordinary firearms. The House planned to hold a hearing on it back in June, but it was postponed after a member of Congress was shot in another horrifying incident of gun violence. 

Four months later, they were going to move on this bill—until the Vegas shooting happened. Now, they have postponed it again.
