Excerpted from [Daily Kos](https://www.dailykos.com/) :

"    More than 50 people were killed (and more than 500 injured) at a mass shooting in Las Vegas last night, and what was Congress about to do? Pass an NRA-sponsored bill to deregulate gun silencers. 

The ridiculously named "Hearing Protection Act" would eliminate restrictions on silencers and instead treat them as ordinary firearms. The House planned to hold a hearing on it back in June, but it was postponed after a member of Congress was shot in another horrifying incident of gun violence. 

Four months later, they were going to move on this billâ€”until the Vegas shooting happened. Now, they have postponed it again.   "
