" NOTHING TO SEE HERE

After all the fanfare, **Mitch McConnell's health care bill** is all too similar to the old bill. Today's Daily Action is again to **call the 7 GOP Senators who didn't support the last version at (844) 241-1141**. Tell them nothing has changed and the following provisions are still completely **unacceptable**:
-**Severe Medicaid Cuts**
-**Inclusion of the Cruz Amendment**, which would allow states to **sell non-ACA compliant plans and skyrocketing premiums** for those with pre-existing conditions.
-**Strips funding from Planned Parenthood**
You already know the drill. This thing won't die until there's overwhelming pressure for these Senators to all go public with their final opposition, so let's make it happen! "
