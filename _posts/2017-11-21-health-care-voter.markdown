HEALTH CARE VOTER
susan --

Thanksgiving is right around the corner -- and this year, we're thankful for this passionate, engaged community of Health Care Voters like you. Millions of Americans still have access to quality, affordable health care because of your efforts, so susan, THANK YOU!

As you know, this administration is dedicated to sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, including its current efforts to discourage participation in the Open Enrollment period that ends on December 15.

So this Thursday, while you're catching up with family or friends, watching the football game, and hopefully eating a hearty meal, don't forget to talk to your loved ones about how important it is to get covered under the Affordable Care Act.

Not sure what exactly to say? No worries -- we jotted down some ideas for you:

What to say on Thanksgiving:

1.  NEED HEALTH INSURANCE?  SIGN UP TODAY AT [**Healthcare.gov**](https://www.healthcare.gov/)

2.  



We know talking about politics can be off-limits at some family gatherings, but this shouldn't be political -- or controversial -- at all. It's about making sure your family and friends are covered in case the unimaginable happens.

And what better way to show you care?

Have a happy and healthy Thanksgiving!
