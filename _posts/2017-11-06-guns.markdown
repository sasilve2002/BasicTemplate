"  Preventing Gun Violence: Tell Your Members of Congress that Their Prayers are Not Enough.  "

"  Congress is considering making mass shootings easier, not preventing them. The gun lobby’s top priorities enjoy wide support in Congress. Legislation has moved forward in the House of Representatives that would make it easier for people to obtain **silencers for guns**. As part of a larger legislative package called the **SHARE Act** ([**Sportsman Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, or H.R. 3668**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3668/text)), Congress is considering the so-called “[**Hearing Protection Act**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/367)” that would pave the way for **convicted felons, domestic abusers**, and others to more easily access **silencers**.
