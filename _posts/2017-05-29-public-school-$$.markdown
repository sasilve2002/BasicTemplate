**Action**: Oppose taxpayer-funded **discrimination** of **LGBTQ+ youth**. (excerpted from Jen Hofmann's Activism Checklist)

**Call: All 3 MoCs** (see bottom of this page for contacts).

**Script**: I am from **_ZIP_** and am concerned that Betsy **DeVos** would have **my tax dollar** fund schools that discriminate against gay kids, which could increase the risk of youth suicide. We need **all schools** to welcome **all kids**. I am asking **_NAME_** to support the use of public money only for **public education** — not the voucher system and not religious education.
