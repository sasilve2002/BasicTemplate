**Action**: Oppose taxpayer-funded **discrimination** of [LGBTQ+ youth](https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2017/05/besty-devos-says-state-funded-schools-can-reject-lgbtq-students/#.WSb0RlYV2q8.facebook).  Excerpted from [Jen Hofmann's Activism Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8HnKq6hcAfbWUa0a-7PPA4S7h9gqkRzFJGu60gJfws/preview). 

**Call: All 3 MoCs** (see bottom of this page for contacts).

**Script**: I am from **___ZIP___** and am concerned that Betsy **DeVos** would have **my tax dollar** fund schools that discriminate against gay kids, which could increase the risk of youth suicide. We need **all schools** to welcome **all kids**. I am asking **___NAME___** to support the use of public money only for **public education** â€” not the voucher system and not religious education.
