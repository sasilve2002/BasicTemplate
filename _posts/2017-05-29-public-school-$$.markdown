**Action**: Oppose taxpayer-funded **discrimination** of **LGBTQ+ youth**. (excerpted from [Jen Hofmann's][](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8HnKq6hcAfbWUa0a-7PPA4S7h9gqkRzFJGu60gJfws/edit) Activism Checklist)(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L8HnKq6hcAfbWUa0a-7PPA4S7h9gqkRzFJGu60gJfws/edit) Activism Checklist)

**Call: All 3 MoCs** (see bottom of this page for contacts).

**Script**: I am from **___ZIP___** and am concerned that Betsy **DeVos** would have **my tax dollar** fund schools that discriminate against gay kids, which could increase the risk of youth suicide. We need **all schools** to welcome **all kids**. I am asking **___NAME___** to support the use of public money only for **public education** — not the voucher system and not religious education.
