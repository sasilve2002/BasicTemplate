**Stop Trump and Pai from [Destroying Local Media](http://billmoyers.com/story/twenty-years-of-media-consolidation-has-not-been-good-for-our-democracy/)**


"   [**FCC** Chairman Ajit **Pai**](https://www.fcc.gov/about/leadership/ajit-pai) wants to **slash** some of the last remaining **protections** we have **against massive media consolidation**. And he wants to ram these changes through **by Nov. 16** with **no public input** or comment.  "

"   Pai’s despicable proposal is nothing but a corporate giveaway to big broadcasters like [**Sinclair**](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/sinclair-broadcasting-puts-partisan-tilt-trusted-local-news). Loosening the local television-ownership rule would make it easier for big broadcasters to gobble up two, three, four or more stations in a single market, which would result in the exact same newscasts on every channel.   "

"   Don't let the FCC silence you: **Urge the agency to block Pai's dangerous proposal**.   "
