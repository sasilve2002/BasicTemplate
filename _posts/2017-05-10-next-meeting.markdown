**Agenda**:  

**1**. Bring your favorite writing implements - we'll be sending postcards and letters in support of some of May's Actions - I have postcards & stamps, but if you have blank postcards, please bring them :)

**2**. We'll sign up for various resistance sites.

**3**. Upcoming marches & events

Please feel free to **bring friends, family, neighbors** to our meetings - each new contact is a success for resisting the Twitter Twit.  It's time to protect our democracy in spite of Twit's distractions.
