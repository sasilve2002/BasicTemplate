*We, in our blue bubble, have senators who are doing an incredible job protecting health care.  However, our phone calls are still necessary, even to our folks - please read on*:

Excerpted from [Isaac Bloom, Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/july-recess-action-plan/) :

"  **Keep those phones ringing**. The phones in congressional offices across the country have been ringing off the hook—this has real impact. Your senators are tallying the number of calls ‘for’ and ‘against’ TrumpCare. **We need an overwhelming majority to call in against**. Urge group members to make calls each day, and maximize your impact by sharing contact information for your MoC in as many venues as possible.

**SAMPLE CALL DIALOGUE: FILIBUSTER BY AMENDMENT**

*Remember - you can restyle the dialogue any way you feel comfortable -* 

Senator **Harris** : (202) 224-3553

Senator **Feinstein**: (202) 224-3841

**Caller**: If the **Senate** moves to proceed to a vote on **TrumpCare**, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, will Senator (** Harris / Feinstein** ) prepare hundreds or thousands of **amendments** to offer during **vote-a-rama**?

**Staffer**: I’m not sure what you mean. Vote-a-rama only lasts a night or so.

**Caller**: That’s because both parties have always agreed to end it. Senator ( **Harris / Feinstein** ) can file thousands of amendments—and then call each of them for a vote—so that debate is prolonged long enough to leave Republicans with no choice but to agree to hearings and a complete CBO score. Along with her colleagues, Senator ( **Feinstein / Harris** ) can and should let the Republicans know they will **hold the floor with amendments** as long as it takes.

**Staffer**: Again, the Senator thinks that could backfire. There are other things we want to work on, as well.

**Caller**: That’s terrible. Like I said, this is the most important thing happening right now. I expect Senator ( **Feinstein / Haris** ) to get in the arena for her constituents. The stakes are too high to leave any tool at her disposal unused.

**Staffer**: I’ll let [Senator] know of your thoughts.

**Caller**: Please do. If she isn’t using these tools, that means she’s not doing everything in her power as a Senator to **stop TrumpCare**. I expect her to use **every tool** she has. That includes **withholding consent** and offering as many **amendments** as it takes to get an open and honest conversation about the bill McConnell is trying to rush through. Please take down **my contact information** so you can let me know when  ( or " as " ) Senator ( **Harris / Feinstein** ) decides ( or " continues " ) to **play hardball**.  "
