Excerpted from [Isaac Bloom, Indivisible](https://www.indivisibleguide.com/resource/july-recess-action-plan/) :

"  **Keep those phones ringing**. The phones in congressional offices across the country have been ringing off the hook—this has real impact. Your senators are tallying the number of calls ‘for’ and ‘against’ TrumpCare. We need an overwhelming majority to call in against. Urge group members to make calls each day, and maximize your impact by sharing contact information for your MoC in as many venues as possible.

**SAMPLE CALL DIALOGUE: FILIBUSTER BY AMENDMENT**

**Caller**: If the **Senate** moves to proceed to a vote on **TrumpCare**, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, will Senator Harris/Feinstein prepare hundreds or thousands of amendments to offer during vote-a-rama?

**Staffer**: I’m not sure what you mean. Vote-a-rama only lasts a night or so.

Caller: That’s because both parties have always agreed to end it. [Senator] can file thousands of amendments—and then call each of them for a vote—so that debate is prolonged long enough to leave Republicans with no choice but to agree to hearings and a complete CBO score. Along with her colleagues, [Senator] can and should let the Republicans know they will hold the floor with amendments as long as it takes.

Staffer: Again, the Senator thinks that could backfire. There are other things we want to work on, as well.

Caller: That’s terrible. Like I said, this is the most important thing happening right now. I expect [Senator] to get in the arena for her constituents. The stakes are too high to leave any tool at her disposal unused.

Staffer: I’ll let [Senator] know of your thoughts.

Caller: Please do. If she isn’t using these tools, that means she’s not doing everything in her power as a Senator to stop TrumpCare. I expect her to use every tool she has. That includes withholding consent and offering as many amendments as it takes to get an open and honest conversation about the bill McConnell is trying to rush through. Please take down my contact information so you can let me know when [Senator] decides to play hardball.  "
