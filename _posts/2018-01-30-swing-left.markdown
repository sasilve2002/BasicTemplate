**Upcoming Canvas Opportunities**

We had a **record turnout** for the fourth Saturday canvassing in **Modesto** on January 27 with over **80 volunteers**. Join the building momentum by signing up for any of the **following scheduled trips to the districts.** 

[**CA-10**:](https://swingleft.org/district/CA-10) The next group trip from the East Bay to Modesto is scheduled for **February 24** and we will be doing these events on the **fourth Saturday of every month through May**. The events run from **10 am - 2 pm** and a meet-up location in **Oakland** is available for those wishing to **carpool**. [**REGISTER here**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfipkKDw9ASXHeNaQz470rs94pTOoxIUDDdSg5kiACy20nJnA/viewform) for the **Modesto** events, or for other opportunities in [**CA-10**](https://swingleft.org/static/resources/primers/district-primer-CA-10.pdf), check out the Swing Left calendar for [**CA-10**](https://swingleft.org/static/resources/primers/district-primer-CA-10.pdf).

**First time volunteers are welcome**! Training is provided on site each time we go out to canvas and **new volunteers are paired with an experienced partner**. While many may be nervous about canvassing, originally reluctant volunteers regularly report how **easy and enjoyable** the experience turned out to be. Engaging with voters **face-to-face** is one of the most **effective** methods for winning political campaigns. Canvassing involves knocking on doors of mostly **registered Democrats**, and your primary goal is **providing information** rather than changing minds.

[**Host a Fundraising House Party This Winter**](https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/better-presidents-wknd-of-action?source=direct_link&&link_id=1&can_id=1dc5066a5d1a5d0c0cd27729589142b4&email_referrer=email_288189&email_subject=lets-make-it-a-better-presidents-day)
This winter, Swing Left volunteers are working together to raise as much money as possible for the Democratic nominees running in 70 Swing Districts in the midterms. A whole bunch of Swing Left volunteers across the country are planning to host fundraising house parties over the holiday weekend coming up next month with the theme of “A Better Presidents' Day.” Fundraisers can include anything from a small fundraiser at your home to a major bash.
 
[Sign up here to host a fundraiser over Presidents' Day weekend](https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/better-presidents-wknd-of-action?source=direct_link&&link_id=1&can_id=1dc5066a5d1a5d0c0cd27729589142b4&email_referrer=email_288189&email_subject=lets-make-it-a-better-presidents-day).
 
We know the idea of throwing a political fundraiser can be a little intimidating—but really it’s just like throwing a party. Here are a few Swing Left volunteers who’ve made it their own: Alane Dasher, a marketing specialist from Virginia, booked a beach shack restaurant on a slow weeknight and a swing dance instructor to teach people how to “swing left.” She also invited some local politicians to speak. In Portland, Oregon, Diana Armstrong and her fellow librarians have made fundraising a regular thing by hosting monthly cocktail parties at their homes. They charge a small cover and give the money to causes and candidates close to their hearts, including Swing Left District Funds. So far they’ve raised more than $1,500 by charging just a few dollars at the door.
 
If this sounds exciting but you’re not sure how to pull it off, an online training with a member of the Swing Left organizing team will be held on February 1 at 5:00 p.m. Sign up for the training HERE.
