Excerpted from [**A Daily Call to Action**](https://www.theloyalopposition.net/mission-statement/) 

"  **Ending DACA** and leaving the Dreamers subject to deportation is not only a **cruel betrayal** of young people raised as Americans, but is also **terrible for the US economy**. Congress must pass the **Dream Act without any conditions**.  "

**YOUR ACTION**:

**Call** your members of Congress and urge them to **support a clean Dream Act**  *(Scroll down this page for more phone numbers)* :

**Senator Dianne Feinstein**
**(202) 224-3841**


**Kamala Harris**
**(202) 224-3553**

**Representative Barbara Lee**
**(202) 225-2661**

**TALKING POINTS** :

This is [NAME] and I’m a constituent in [ZIP].

I urge [Sen/Rep____ to support [[**S.1615**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1615)/[**H.R.3440**](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3440)], **the Dream Act, without conditions or trade-offs**.

The **Dreamers** arrived in the US through no fault of their own and have been **raised as Americans**.

The **Dreamers contribute** to American society in jobs, the military and education.

Studies show **deportation** of the Dreamers would have devastating **economic impacts** on the US.

**Breaking faith** with the Dreamers or **holding them hostage** to funding for a useless wall or other costly border control measures would be **cruel and un-American**.

Please support a clean **Dream Act without conditions or trade-offs**.
