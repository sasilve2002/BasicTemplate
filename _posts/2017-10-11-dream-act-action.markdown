Excerpted from [A Daily Call to Action](https://www.theloyalopposition.net/mission-statement/) :

"  Ending DACA and leaving the Dreamers subject to deportation is not only a cruel betrayal of young people raised as Americans, but is also terrible for the US economy. Congress must pass the Dream Act without any conditions.  "

Call your members of Congress and urge them to support a clean Dream Act :

Senator Dianne Feinstein
(202) 224-3841

Kamala Harris
(202) 224-3553

Representative Barbara Lee
(202) 225-2661


Talking Points

This is [NAME] and Iâ€™m a constituent in [ZIP].
I urge [Sen/Rep____ to support [S.1615/H.R.3440], the Dream Act, without conditions or trade-offs.
The Dreamers arrived in the US through no fault of their own and have been raised as Americans.
The Dreamers contribute to American society in jobs, the military and education.
Studies show deportation of the Dreamers would have devastating economic impacts on the US.
Breaking faith with the Dreamers or holding them hostage to funding for a useless wall or other costly border control measures would be cruel and un-American.
