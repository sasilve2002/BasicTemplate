Excerpted from the [**Daily Kos**](https://www.dailykos.com/) :

"This week, Senate Majority Leader [**Mitch McConnell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_McConnell) will finally allow a **week of floor debate** to address **any immigration issue** that members want to tackle.

This is an **opportunity** to secure legislative protections for **immigrant youth**. We need a final bill that safeguards the **most people and does the least harm** to families and communities. 

It'll be an **uphill battle** but [**DREAMers**](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/04/donald-trump-what-is-daca-dreamers) are supported **across partisan lines** and both sides are looking for a win. Let's make sure **pro-migrants and people of conscience** are **louder** than **MAGA** ("*make America great again*") and **white supremacists**."
  
"**Call** Senator Kamala D. **Harris** at **(202) 224-3553** and Senator Dianne **Feinstein** at **(415) 393-0707**. Demand they support narrow legislation that focuses on protections for immigrant youth."

***Sample Script***:

**Hi, my name is** [ name] **from** [zip code] **in Oakland. I am calling to urge Senator Kamala D. Harris and Senator Dianne Feinstein to focus on a narrow bill that protects immigrant youth from deportation. Dreamers are widely supported across partisan lines. There is no acceptable reason to continue delaying. Let's focus on a bill that most Americans would support -- one that primarily protects immigrant youth -- and address larger questions on immigration another day. Thank you for your time.**
