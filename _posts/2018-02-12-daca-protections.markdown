Call Senator Kamala D. Harris at (202) 224-3553 and Senator Dianne Feinstein at (202) 224-3841. Demand they support narrow legislation that focuses on protections for immigrant youth.
Hi, my name is Susan from 94619 in Oakland. I am calling to urge Senator Kamala D. Harris and Senator Dianne Feinstein to focus on a narrow bill that protects immigrant youth from deportation. Dreamers are widely supported across partisan lines. There is no acceptable reason to continue delaying. Let's focus on a bill that most Americans would support -- one that primarily protects immigrant youth -- and address larger questions on immigration another day. Thank you for your time.
