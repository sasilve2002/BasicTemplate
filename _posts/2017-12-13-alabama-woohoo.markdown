"  ***Daily Thank You 12.13.2017***  "

"  WOOHOO!! **THANK YOU Alabama** for helping to "bend that moral arc a little closer to that justice" last night. We're all **celebrating with you**!  "

"  [**Click here to watch Doug Jones' victory speech**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9AY1KtIDYI).  "

"  And then **send the entire campaign** staff a special congratulatory **thank you card**!  "
