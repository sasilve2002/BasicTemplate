**What's happening with the resistance?**  [Here's an **excerpt from Salon, May 17th**:  ](http://www.salon.com/2017/05/17/future-of-the-resistance-where-does-the-anti-trump-movement-go-from-here/)


"Anti-Trump sentiment should be an impetus to political action, but stopping one man cannot be the only or even the primary objective. The anti-Trump resistance must fight for a better future â€” not just a future where it is impossible for a demagogue like Donald Trump to be elected president, but a future where exploitative and unscrupulous billionaires like Donald Trump no longer exist."

And, from Thomas **Friedman** in the [**May 16th NY Times**:](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/opinion/trump-republicans-2018-elections.html?_r=0)

"...Trump's presidency...is a threat to the rule of law, freedom of the press, ethics in government, the integrity of our institutions, the values our kids need to learn from their president and America's longstanding role as the respected leader of the free world."



**We're on the right path :)**
