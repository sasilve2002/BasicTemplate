What's happening with the resistance?  [Here's an excerpt from Salon:  ](http://www.salon.com/2017/05/17/future-of-the-resistance-where-does-the-anti-trump-movement-go-from-here/)


"Anti-Trump sentiment should be an impetus to political action, but stopping one man cannot be the only or even the primary objective. The anti-Trump resistance must fight for a better future â€” not just a future where it is impossible for a demagogue like Donald Trump to be elected president, but a future where exploitative and unscrupulous billionaires like Donald Trump no longer exist."

We're on the right path :)
