Excerpted from [Rogan's Today List](http://roganslist.blogspot.com/) :

The **Center for Medicare and Medicaid Studies** is asking for **public comment** on their effort to **chip away at the Affordable Care Act**.  Let's tell them we want them to save the protections the ACA created. 

Click here for [**instructions** on how to submit comments](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/06/12/2017-12130/reducing-regulatory-burdens-imposed-by-the-patient-protection-and-affordable-care-act-and-improving#addresses.).

Here is an example of a script - cut & paste:

The ACA must be protected so that the millions of Americans who depend on it for their health care will not be left unprotected.  There is no excuse for a country as rich as ours which is fortunate to have the latest medical advances available, does not fully protect the health care of all its citizens.  This CMS Proposed Rule's title is misleading:  the rule cannot protect patients' rights by reducing the regulations that protect patients.  Please make sure that the protections offered by the ACA are not obliterated by this Proposed Rule.

It looks complicated but give it a try - it's worth it :)
