"  This week the **Senate** is expected to vote on the **nomination of Randal Quarles** to the **Federal Reserve Board of Governors**. [**EPI**](http://www.epi.org/)’s Josh Bivens explains why Randal **Quarles** should not be confirmed to the Federal Reserve, citing Quarles’ **Wall Street** ties and Quarles’ arguments **against** efforts to aggressively pursue genuine **full employment**—which would lead to higher wages for workers.   "
