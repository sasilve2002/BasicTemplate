"  This week the Senate is expected to vote on the nomination of Randal Quarles to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. [EPI](http://www.epi.org/)’s Josh Bivens explains why Randal Quarles should not be confirmed to the Federal Reserve, citing Quarles’ Wall Street ties and Quarles’ arguments against efforts to aggressively pursue genuine full employment—which would lead to higher wages for workers.
