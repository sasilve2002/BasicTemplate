" [**Share** your thoughts on Trump's foreign policy and the war in **Afghanistan**](http://go.commondefensepac.com/page/s/afghanistan-survey?source=em20170822):

Late last night, **Trump** stood in front of a room full of troops to **congratulate himself** on continuing the **war in Afghanistan**. After nearly **16 years of war** — a war that has claimed more than **100,000 lives** and cost nearly **$1 trillion dollars** — it is vital that we speak out and demand real answers, not empty rhetoric.

We already have thousands of US service members still deployed in Afghanistan without any clear strategy, and adding more won’t magically solve the region’s problems. Many of us served in Afghanistan, and many more had family deployed there as well. We’ve earned the right to have our voices heard.

Common Defense is ready to address this, but **we want your input** first. Will you share your thoughts on Trump’s announcement and the war in Afghanistan with us?

This is a crucial moment. Regardless of what your thoughts are on the war, Trump’s decisions could put thousands of U.S. lives on the line, and your responses will help shape how Common Defense addresses this. To do that, I need you to share your opinion on the wars in Afghanistan right now.

I was deployed to Afghanistan in 2003 as a medic with the 82nd Airborne. And I’ve been very vocal about about my thoughts on that war because that’s a part of my duty as a citizen of the United States. That’s what democracy looks like, and I thank you for sharing your thoughts with us today.

In solidarity,
