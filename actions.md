Actions – week of May 1, 2017

The house is trying repeal the ACA again. The modified bill** HR 1628** (Trumpcare) is more draconian than the first version – that’s why the **Freedom Caucus** - **conservative and libertarian Republican members of the United States House of Representatives** - is on board. The word at this point is the Republicans just need 2 more votes to pass it. You know all our MoCs are on board, so it is time to call outside our district.

These Republicans are still undecided on HR 1628 (Trumpcare rerun):

McHenry, NC – (202)225-2576
Stefanik, NY - (202)225-4611
Valadado, CA - (202)225-4695
Yoder, KS - (202)225-2865
Diaz-Balart, FL - (202)225-4211
Frelinghuysen, NJ - (202)225-5034
Paulsen, MN - (202)225-.2871
Kinzinger, IA - (202)225-3635

**Call Script: VOTE NO on Trumpcare, don't strip away health care from Americans.**

These calls are working!  Fight on!
