**Action #2:**

**Protect Healthcare - Oppose Trumpcare

Still time to make these calls - big vote today:
**
The house is trying repeal the ACA again. The modified bill** HR 1628** (Trumpcare) is more draconian than the first version – that’s why the **Freedom Caucus** - **conservative and libertarian Republican members of the United States House of Representatives** - is on board. The word at this point is the Republicans just need 2 more votes to pass it. You know all our MoCs are on board, so it is time to call outside our district.

These Republicans are still undecided on HR 1628 (Trumpcare rerun):

McHenry, NC – (202)225-2576

Stefanik, NY - (202)225-4611

Valadado, CA - (202)225-4695

Yoder, KS - (202)225-2865

Diaz-Balart, FL - (202)225-4211

Frelinghuysen, NJ - (202)225-5034

Paulsen, MN - (202)225-.2871

Kinzinger, IA - (202)225-3635

**Call Script: VOTE NO on Trumpcare, don't strip away health care from Americans.**

**These calls are working!  Fight on!**
