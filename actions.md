**Action #2:**

**Protect Healthcare - Oppose Trumpcare

Still time to make these calls - big vote today:
**
The house is trying repeal the ACA again. The modified bill** HR 1628** (Trumpcare) is more draconian than the first version – that’s why the **Freedom Caucus** - **conservative and libertarian Republican members of the United States House of Representatives** - is on board. The word at this point is the Republicans just need 2 more votes to pass it. You know all our MoCs are on board, so it is time to call outside our district.

**These Republicans are still undecided on HR 1628 (Trumpcare rerun)**:

McHenry, NC – (202)225-2576

Stefanik, NY - (202)225-4611

Valadado, CA - (202)225-4695

Yoder, KS - (202)225-2865

Diaz-Balart, FL - (202)225-4211

Frelinghuysen, NJ - (202)225-5034

Paulsen, MN - (202)225-.2871

Kinzinger, IA - (202)225-3635

**Call Script: VOTE NO on Trumpcare, don't strip away health care from Americans.**

**These calls are working!  Fight on!**
