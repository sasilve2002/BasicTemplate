**Nothing Rhymes with Orange**

It's *strange* that no work rhymes with *orange*.

That lack of rhyme seems apt to me.

I might suggest the word *revenge.*

The orange one sows disharmony.

```````````````````````````````````````

The *unhinged* despot wields his power,

his chief concern to please his base.

His lies and upsets mount each hour;

his mantra is "Repeal and Replace."

```````````````````````````````````````
The orange one can be counted on

to *avenge* his real or imagined slights.

His staff and partisans learned to fawn.

Their bully-in-chief delights in fights.

```````````````````````````````````````

The orange man draws the radical *fringe*

that seeks to destroy our democracy.

Mere thought of him can make me *cringe!*

I recoil at his hypocrisy.

```````````````````````````````````````

How many laws can he *infringe*

and still incur no penalty?

His actions make me want to *binge*

on food or drink to blur reality.

```````````````````````````````````````

Instead, I'll pledge to join the fight

with **Indivisibles** defending our nation.

History will one day prove us right,

a time in our land for jubilation!
