**Nothing Rhymes with Orange**

It's *strange* that no work rhymes with *orange*.
That lack of rhyme seems apt to me.
I might suggest the word *revenge.*
The orange one sows disharmony.

The *unhinged* despot wields his power,
his chief concern to please his base.
His lies and upsets mount each hour;
his mantra is "Repeal and Replace."

The orange one can be counted on
to *avenge* his real or imagined slights.
His staff and partisans learned to fawn.
Their bully-in-chief delights in fights.

The orange man draws the radical *fringe*
that seeks to destroy our democracy.
Mere thought of him can make me *cringe!*
I recoil at his hypocrisy.

How many laws can he *infringe*
and still incur no penalty?
His actions make me want to *binge*
on food or drink to blur reality.

Instead, I'll pledge to join the fight
with **Indivisibles** defending our nation.
History will one day prove us right,
a time in our land for jubilation!
