Excerpted from **Flippable.org** - 

"Another **SCOTUS** win: North Carolina Republicans were handed another defeat this week when the **Supreme Court affirmed** that 28 of the stateâ€™s legislative districts were drawn with **racial bias**. These district lines will be redrawn, giving NC voters a fairer chance to be heard in **2018**."
