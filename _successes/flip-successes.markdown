New Hampshire and New York flip state seats! On Tuesday night, voters in Carroll County, NH, flipped a reliably Republican State House seat blue. Representative-elect Edith DesMarais will be the first-ever Democrat to hold this seat. And in Long Island, NY, in a district Trump won by 23 points, public school teacher and Democrat Christine Pellegrino flipped her State Assembly seat blue. These are the first flipped state seats since Trump’s election, and a clear indication that our movement is working.

Montana voters go to the polls. On Thursday, voters in Montana will elect their next Congressperson. We’re proud to have partnered with Swing Left, who coordinated hundreds of thousands of phone calls into Montana to get out the vote for Democrat Rob Quist. We’ll be following the results on our Twitter feed.

Georgia’s looking up for Democrats. On Monday, a poll of Georgia’s 6th District showed Democrat Jon Ossoff with a 7-point lead over Republican Karen Handel in the race for this traditionally red seat. Georgia has seen extensive gerrymandering benefitting the GOP—making Ossoff’s lead all the more meaningful.
