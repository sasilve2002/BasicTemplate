***VICTORIES***!

1. After multiple states refused to participate in **Trump’s** ridiculous and disastrous **investigation** into a crime that does not exist, he finally **dissolved his ruse of a voter fraud commission**.

2. **Newark, NJ** is pushing back against the FCC’s net neutrality decision by keeping its fiber-optic internet connection **net neutral**. #GoodOptics

3. **New York** and **California**’s governors **pardoned** more than 20 **immigrants** so they **won’t be deported**, including a transgender activist who can now apply for a green card with her correct gender.

4. In our end of year recap, we said 16,000 **women** told Emily’s List they want to **run for office**, but the updated number is actually way higher — **25,000**, to be exact.
 


5. Thanks to a new law, people in **California** will **no longer** have to **disclose** previous **criminal history** or past **salaries** to potential employers.

6. Mike **Pence’s** Coloradan neighbors **welcomed** him in the best way possible while he was on a visit to their great state last week.

7. Another California victory: A court ruled that a student athlete can’t be forced to stand for the national anthem. As the student’s lawyer said,
 
“Students like our client, who conscientiously carry their values and ideals with them, cannot be silenced.”

8. Women in Hollywood launched Time’s Up, a huge initiative to combat sexual harassment with a legal defense fund to help low-income women working in a variety of fields—including the farmworkers who stood in solidarity with actresses a few months ago.

9. We’re also happy to report (pun intended!) that the Hollywood Reporter has assigned seven reporters to a brand new sexual misconduct beat. 📰 👍

10. A new law that makes it illegal to pay men more than women just went into effect in Iceland. #EverywhereNowPlease

11. In the first year since New Jersey got rid of cash bail, county jail populations dropped by 17%. 🙌

12. 18 states are raising the minimum wage this year. You can check to see if your state is on the list here.

13. A court ruled that an Obama-era regulation helping low-income families in 23 metropolitan areas would go into effect on January 1st.
