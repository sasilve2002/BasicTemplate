***VICTORIES***!

1. After multiple states refused to participate in **Trump’s** ridiculous and disastrous **investigation** into a crime that does not exist, he finally **dissolved his ruse of a voter fraud commission**.

2. **Newark, NJ** is pushing back against the FCC’s net neutrality decision by keeping its fiber-optic internet connection **net neutral**. #GoodOptics

3. **New York** and **California**’s governors **pardoned** more than 20 **immigrants** so they **won’t be deported**, including a transgender activist who can now apply for a green card with her correct gender.

4. In our end of year recap, we said 16,000 **women** told Emily’s List they want to **run for office**, but the updated number is actually way higher — **25,000**, to be exact.
 
5. Thanks to a new law, people in **California** will **no longer** have to **disclose** previous **criminal history** or past **salaries** to potential employers.

6. Mike **Pence’s** Coloradan neighbors **welcomed** him in the best way possible while he was on a visit to their great state last week.

7. Another **California** victory: A court ruled that a **student athlete can’t be forced to stand for the national anthem**. As the student’s lawyer said,
 
“Students like our client, who conscientiously carry their values and ideals with them, cannot be silenced.”

8. Women in Hollywood launched Time’s Up, a huge initiative to combat sexual harassment with a legal defense fund to help low-income women working in a variety of fields—including the farmworkers who stood in solidarity with actresses a few months ago.

9. We’re also happy to report (pun intended!) that the Hollywood Reporter has assigned seven reporters to a brand new sexual misconduct beat. 📰 👍

10. A new law that makes it illegal to pay men more than women just went into effect in Iceland. #EverywhereNowPlease

11. In the first year since New Jersey got rid of cash bail, county jail populations dropped by 17%. 🙌

12. 18 states are raising the minimum wage this year. You can check to see if your state is on the list here.

13. A court ruled that an Obama-era regulation helping low-income families in 23 metropolitan areas would go into effect on January 1st.
