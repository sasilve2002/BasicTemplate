***VICTORIES***!

1. After multiple states refused to participate in **Trump‚Äôs** ridiculous and disastrous **investigation** into a crime that does not exist, he finally **[dissolved his ruse of a voter fraud commission](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html?utm_source=Small%2BVictories%2BNewsletter&utm_campaign=fbefd8b4da-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_636f315e88-fbefd8b4da-142027269&_r=0&auth=login-email)**.

2. **Newark, NJ** is pushing back against the FCC‚Äôs net neutrality decision by [keeping its fiber-optic internet connection](https://www.axios.com/newark-commits-to-keeping-its-fiber-network-net-neutral-2519349873.html?utm_source=Small+Victories+Newsletter&utm_campaign=fbefd8b4da-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_636f315e88-fbefd8b4da-142027269) **net neutral**. #GoodOptics

3. **New York** and **California**‚Äôs governors **[pardoned](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/nyregion/trump-cuomo-pardons-immigrants.html?utm_source=Small+Victories+Newsletter&utm_campaign=fbefd8b4da-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_636f315e88-fbefd8b4da-142027269)** more than 20 **immigrants** so they **won‚Äôt be deported**, including a transgender activist who can now apply for a green card with her correct gender.

4. In our end of year recap, we said 16,000 **women** told Emily‚Äôs List they want to **run for office**, but the [updated number](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/365855-emilys-list-25000-women-have-reached-out-to-us-to-run-for-office?utm_source=Small+Victories+Newsletter&utm_campaign=fbefd8b4da-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_05&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_636f315e88-fbefd8b4da-142027269) is actually way higher ‚Äî **25,000**, to be exact.
 
5. Thanks to a new law, people in **California** will **no longer** have to **disclose** previous **criminal history** or past **salaries** to potential employers.

6. Mike **Pence‚Äôs** Coloradan neighbors **welcomed** him in the best way possible while he was on a visit to their great state last week.

7. Another **California** victory: A court ruled that a **student athlete can‚Äôt be forced to stand for the national anthem**. As the student‚Äôs lawyer said,
 
‚ÄúStudents like our client, who conscientiously carry their values and ideals with them, cannot be silenced.‚Äù

8. Women in Hollywood launched **[Time‚Äôs Up](https://www.timesupnow.com/)**, a huge initiative to combat **sexual harassment** with a **legal defense fund** to help **low-income women** working in a variety of fields‚Äîincluding the farmworkers who stood in solidarity with actresses a few months ago.

9. We‚Äôre also happy to report (pun intended!) that the Hollywood Reporter has assigned seven reporters to a brand new sexual misconduct beat. üì∞ üëç

10. A new law that makes it illegal to pay men more than women just went into effect in Iceland. #EverywhereNowPlease

11. In the first year since New Jersey got rid of cash bail, county jail populations dropped by 17%. üôå

12. 18 states are raising the minimum wage this year. You can check to see if your state is on the list here.

13. A court ruled that an Obama-era regulation helping low-income families in 23 metropolitan areas would go into effect on January 1st.
