1. First, please read the "TwitCare" post for an update on yesterday's vote in Congress.

2. Second, **call** our Barbara Lee to **thank her** for fighting TwitCare.

Script:  Thank you for voting NO on repealing the ACA/Obamacare unless and until there is a simultaneous replacement.  The ACA has made it possible for (here's your family or friend or neighbor, etc. story) 20 million more Americans to get health insurance, reduced the uninsured rate to the lowest in history, and made health insurance within reach for millions of people. Thank you for supporting our affordable healthcare.

**Representative Barbara Lee** Dist. 13

**510-763-0370**
**202-225-2661**

3. Then **call** our senators **to support** their efforts to save Affordable Care. 

Script:  Yesterday, Republicans got TrumpCare passed in the House by making it more extreme. The ACA has made it possible for (here's your family or friend or neighbor, etc. story) 20 million more Americans to get health insurance, reduced the uninsured rate to the lowest in history, and made health insurance within reach for millions of people. Please continue your fight to protect Affordable Care.

**Senator Dianne Feinstein**


**415-393-0707,**
**619-231-9712,**
**310-914-7300,**
**559-485-7430**

**Senator Kamila Harris**


**202-224-3553,**
**916-448-2787,**
**559-497-5109,**
**213-894-5000,**
**415-355-9041,**
**619-239-3884,**

**These calls work** (in spite of the **non"Freedom** Caucus" continuing to contribut millions of $$$ to fight ACA).  

We have a real chance to protect healthcare.  

**Together we will win !**
